Inferences from the Premisses. 1 By Compareing the extent of the Territory, with the number of the people it appeares that Ireland is much under peopled for as much as there are  above 10 Acres of good land to every head in Ireland, whereas in England, and France these are but 4, and in Holland Scarce one. 2 If there be 250 thousand space hands capable of Labour who can earle 4: or 5li: per Annum one with annother.

From all which and from the settlement of Estates it is to be hoped that men seeing more advantage to live in Ireland then  else where may be Invited  to remove themselves thither, and soe Supply the want of people the greatest + most fundamentall Defect of that kingdom. Certaine generall Rules collected concerning money and Bullion out of the late consultation att Court in a speech made by Sir Thomas Roe att the Councell Table 1640  Go and Silver have a two fold Estimation, in the extrinsique value, as they {are} moneys and princes measure given to their People  and this is a Prerogative of kings: or in the Intrinsique as they are Commodities valuing each other according to their Plenty or Scarcity, and soe all other Commodities by them and this is the sole power of Trade. The measure in a kingdom ought to be Constant. It is the Iustice, and honor of the king, for if they be altered all men att that time are deceived in their precedent Contracts either for lands or moneys, and the king most of all. For noe man knoweth either what he hath or what he oweth. This made the Lord Treasurer Burleigh in  anno 1573 (when Some Projectors had sett on Foott a matter of that nature) to tell them the they  were worthy to Suffer death, for attempting to put soe great a dishonor upon the Queen + Detriment + discontent on the people for to alter this publique measure is to leave all the marketts of the kingdome unfurnished + what will be the mischiefe the proclamations of the 5th. + 6th: of Queen Mary and 4th and of Eliz: will manifest, when but a rancor 
        
         <453v> 
        
        produced that effect soe farr, that besides the faith of those Princes to the Contrary dlivered in theire Edicts they were Inforced to cause the Magistrates in every Shire respectively to Constrayne the people to furnish the marketts to prevent a mutiny. To thinke then this measure att this time {Short} is to Raise all Prizes or to tune the measure or money now currant into disuse + Bullion, for who will part with any, when it is by sven more in the hundred in the masse then the new moneys + yet of noe more value in the markett. Hence the necessity of it will follow that there will not of a long time be minted of the new moneys Sufficient to drive the exchange of the kingdome, and soe all trade att one  instant will be att a Stand, + in the mean time the markes unfurnished, and thus farr as money is a measure. Now as Commodity it is respected + valued by the Intrinsique quality + first the one mettall to the other. All commodities are prized by plenty or scarcity by dearnesse or cheapnesse the one to the other.  If then wee desire our silver to buy gold as it hath lately been we must lett it be the cheaper + lesse valued in proportion; and so contrary For one equivalent Proportion in  both will bring in neither. Wee see the proffitt thereof by the unusuall  quantities of gold brought lately to the mint by reason of the price wee rate it abve all other Countrys gold maybe bought too deare. To furnish then this way the mint with both is Impossible. And att this time it was apparently proved both by the best Artists, + Merchants most acquainted with the exchange in both the examples of the mint masters in the RixDollers + Royalls of eight,  that silver here us if equall value + gold above which forraigne parts in the Instrinsique value, but Sallarys presented to the Lords by the Mint master is only the nomination ofit's extrinsique Quality. But if wee desire both it is not the raising the value that doth it but the ballancing the Trade, for if we buy more then wee sell of all other Commodities be the money never So high prized wee must part with it to make the Disproportion eaven, if  wee sell more, then the Contrary will follow. And this is plaine in the Spanish necessities, for should that King advance to a double Royall of eight, yett needing by reason of the barroness of this Country more of forreaign  wares then he can countervaile by exchange 
        with his own ares he must then part with his money & gain no more by exchanging his Coyne then before, but will pay a higher price for the Commodities he  buyeth if this wrke of raiseing be his owne. But if wee Shall make Improvement of Gould + Silver being the Staple Commoditys of this kingdome to the fashion of the Netherlands, were to {fram} a Royall monarchy by a Society of merchants, their Country is a continuall Faire, + Soe the price of moneys must ryse, + fall to fitt their ooccasions. We see this by raising the exchange at Frankford and other places att the usuall times the marts. This frequent + dayly change in the low Countryes of these moneys is noe Such injustice to any three as it would be here, For there they being all merchants or mechanickes the can rate accordingly theire labour, and theire ware whether it be Coyne or other merchandise, the the Condition  of their own money in exchange. And our English merchants to whose profession it properly belongeth doe soe according to the Iust intinsique value of their forraigne Coynes in all barter  of Commodities or exchange except usance which we that and rated + tyed by the extrinsique measure of moneys in all our constant Reckonings, and annuall Bargains att home cannot Doe. And for us then to raise our coyn at this time to equall theire Proportions were but to render our selves to a perpetuall incertainty, For they will Raise there upon {the} dayly againe which we have of Course must follow, or else Receive noe Profitt by this presnet Change and soe destroy the pollicy, Iustice Honour and tranquility  of our state for ever.

Macy for a misdemeanour for having clippings & clipping instruments found in their house at Elin mare Acton in Middlesex. The evidence for the King were Iohn Whitwood, David Tuccar & a Constable: who deposed that by virtue of my Lord chief Iustice Holt's warrant they went to the said             's house in expectation to find there several Highway-men, as my Lord was informed were harboured there; But they found no person in the house save the man & his wife. The witnesses searched the house for arms, instead of which they found clippings, clipt money, filings, sheers, files &c & brought the same together with the man & woman before my Lord Chief Iustice Holt who committed them to Newgate. Vpon their arraignment they pleaded not guilty & being brought upon their trial my Lord Chief Iustice called for the Indictment & read it, complaining that the crime was of a higher nature then that Bill set forth, which he ordered to be quasht & commanded the said G. M. to go to Hickses Hall & cause a Bill to be drawn for High Treason which the Iustices there upon the Bench were of opinion ought not to be don. Yet upon Macy & Tuccar their making oath it was his Lordships command did at last permit it, but it was with great difficulty that they themselves perswaded the Grand Iury to find hte Bill. The men & his wife were arraignd tryed & found guilty upon it. In their defence they alledged that these things did belong to persons who frequented their house. And if it were otherwise it could be but circumstantial evidence against them, for that the law required two eye witnesses of the matter of fact. My Lord replied they misconstrued the statute, that these instruments were sufficient evidence the sheers supplying the place of one witness, the filings of anoth{er} the files & rough clipt money of another. A year & half ago at an Assize at Lancaster a person was there tried before my Lord Chief Iustice {Treby} & convicted for counterfeiting of money upon a bill of Indictment found against him eighteen years before. for that he had fled & lived in Ireland but newly returned was taken & the same witnesses being alive appeared against him. Ergo an Indictment is not invalidated by time alone. About 3 or 4 years since one Momforth a Dutchman having acquaintance with the Casshire of Monsr Vanderesch  who is paymaster of the Dutch forces: persuaded or tempted the said Clerk (or Casshire) to be confederate with him in clipping on money. Momfort being in private with the Casshire proposed how he should quickly get an estate & told him the manner by shewing him some clipt money out of one pocket & broad money out of another, saying this narrow was made so from this broad this very day & I my self did it. Further that the young man should be only concerned to furnish him broad money for clipt & should receive only 2s in the pound advantage. The Casshire was surprized within himself but did not show it outwardly & as soon as they parted he discovered this intrigue to his Master who made it known to Mr Bridgman of the Secretaries office & he advised that the Casshire should comply with the proposals of Momfort & exchange money with him, but with all to contrive that a witness or two should be in the next room to hear & see what was done. And it happend that there was only a wainscot between the Room where the Casshire received & paid this mony & the other room where the witnesses conceald themselves & through a crevise saw & heard Momfort at an appointed time pay 5℔ in clipt money unto the Casshire in liew of broad money & threw down 4 clipt half crowns for the exchange at 2s per pound. But the Casshire returned it saying, Let it alone till the next time. Another day he brought 5℔ more of clipt money & paid to the Casshire in lieu of so much broad money together with 8 clipt half crowns for the exchange of both summs. This was in like manner observed by the aforesaid witnesses. The third time Momfort brought about 20℔ in clipt money & was exchanging the same with the 2 witnesses, rusht in upon them & secured the man (Momfort) & the money. Mr Attorney general Treby directed a Bill of high Treason to be brought against him, & my Lord Chief Iustice Polluxfin being then upon the Bench ordered the statute to be read  & directed the Iury to find him guilty for aiding & abetting which was as much Treason as clipping. And accordingly he was found guilty & executed."

A Quarter of a year after another Privy seal was therefore granted for the clippings & clipt money & personal estate after conviction, which last condition proved a hindrance to the Warden from seizing because they were more acquitted then convicted & for the generality they were poor people worth little or nothing.

II. against Clipping (where there is a Salvo of their Rights to Lords of Manners) doth require the Grants by which they Claime to bee good and lawfull, which cannot bee knowne to such till they bee declared so by some Court of Law.  6) The goods and Tooles of Clippers, Clippings & fileings of money & all Clipt and counterfeit coyne, have in all former Times been seized and Secured by the Officers of the Mint only, And the Bayliffe of Westminster who had the same Grant and Right then, as hee hath now, never pretended to those seizures.  7) Their late and present Majesties have by Privy seale Authorized the Lord Treasurer or Comissioners of the Treasury for the Time being to take and receive all goods and forfeitures of Clippers & false Coyners, And you Lordshipps have accordingly by your Warrant upon such privy Seale deputed the Warden of the Mint to doe the same  8) The directing those small forfeitures from the Mint Takes away the means of defraying the expences and rewarding the labour of such as assist (sometimes whole nights & often to the hazard of your lives) in seizeing many desperate Criminalls, and discourage them from being ready to help upon sudden Occasions, & the imprisoning the Constables in the very Case by the Bayliffe of Westminster will have the same ill effect, since they acted in pursuance of their majesties Privy seale to your Lordships and of your Warrant thereupon to the Warden of the Mint 9) The Warden of the Mint his Clerk has hitherto been at the trouble of Seizeing as well as prosecuteing such Criminalls, and defrayed the Charges of it, chiefly out of such clippings, Clipt money, Tooles &c. as were seized, and it were {hard} that the Bayliff of Westminster (who contributes nothing to the said Service) should run away with such small seizures as well as with all the Fines of Offenders about the Coine, which were never contested with him as being not mentioned within the Privy seale granted to your Lordships. These matters against his Equity for him to have an Equitable Construction upon such presumption of a Grant to have the Goods &c. And the King to bee at the Charge of Prosecution and presenting the mischief.  10) If the Bayliffe of Westminster has a right to Clippings & fileings of money, melted Silver &c. hee has also the same right to the Tooles used by Clippers and false Coiners, as Stamps, Coyning Presses edging Engines, Melting potts, &c. Which the Government hath allways endeavored to secure from all other hands, Than those of the Sworen Officers of the Mint  11) If the Bayliffe of Westminster obtaines these Seizeures Those of diverse other Libertys will pretend (as they do now) to the like, And either they must bee permitted to possess themselves of what doth not appeare to bee their Right, or your Lordshipps bee Continually Troubled with Complaints about it.  12) The Certificate now before you Lordships Signed by the Two Constables Batson and Bridgman being a true state of the case of Vdalls alias Rawlinsons melted Silver &c. Seized, is humbly desired may bee Read with this Memorial  Clippings &c. was made Treason by Statute long after the pretended Grants to the Abbot (vizt) in Queen Mary & Eliza. therefore will the Forfeitures by these Statutes run along with the former Grant, or belong they to the King, the Offences being made Treason since the Grants.

'Proposals touching the Amendment of the English Coins'.,"Proposals touching the Amendment of the English coins. Proposal I. That Bullion & Milled money be enacted of an equal value under a severe penalty to any one who shall give or take more then the value of a crown piece for an ounce of bullion For the raising ye price of bullion has for some years put a stop to the Mint & caused milled money to be either melted down into bullion & base money or transported & sold for bullion abroad. And these mischiefs are not otherwise to be remedied then by this Proposal. Proposal II. That a crown piece & an ounce of Bullion be enacted (at present) of a middle value between them both; suppose at 5s 6d, or 5s 8d or at most 6s; & that every year, or every half year, a penny be deducted from their common value untill they be both brought down to 5s. For this temper of the value will make the least alteration in the present state of affairs, & so is safest; & the grevances which may arise to some persons from equalling the value of milled money & bullion will this become moderate & of short continuance. For should bullion on a sudden be brought down to the value of milled money, it might be too detrimentall to all that trade in bullion & Plate, & should milled money be raised to the present value of bullion suppose a crown piece to 6s 3d or 6s. 6d it might cause too great profit to those who have milled money hoarded &  raise the price of all merchandices too much to the injury of Land, standing rents & Annuities & of all estates which cannot rise in the same proportion. But if it be set at 5s 6d or 5s 8d or perhaps 6s the injury already done to standing estates by the rise of bullion, will be abated by the present Fall thereof & in a few years by the reduction of its value to 5s per ounce, it will cease Proposal III. That all the unmilled half crowns be speedily milled into half ounce pieces of sterling allay, & of a particular new stamp whereby they may be easily distinguished in tale from the other milled half crowns; & that a common value  be set upon them (at present) almost equal to the value of the money out of which they are coyned, suppose of 3s or 3s 6d or 4s or at most 4s 6d the piece, & that this value be lessened a penny or 2d in the piece every year, or every half year, untill it be brought down to 2s 6d, which 
        
         <605v> 
    
    is the just intrinsick value of the pieces. I propose this as reasonable to be now done because 'tis better in all respects then to let the unmilled money continue as it is. For it will make the least alteration in the affairs of the nation & so is safest for the Government. The quantity of money will not be thereby too much diminished on a sudden.  I propose it to be done speedily for putting an end to clipping half crowns. And tho this new money will for a time went of intrinsick value yet this is no new grievance but a step to the remedy of the old one. For it will be of more intrinsick value then the current money is at present, & every year grow better and better till it have its Full intrinsick value: which gradual amendment will be safer to the government then too sudden a change. And the losse by milling may not be so great but that every subject may beare it without putting the nation to charge, or calling in plate before it be necessary, which would make an ill sound abroad. And tho its want of intrinsick value will for a time make it liable to be counterfeited, yet it will be much lesse liable thereto then the unmilled money is at present Proposal IV That no bullion or plate be milled with this new stamp upon pain  of treason, nor brought to the Mint during the milling of this money; & that so soon as the time is expired for milling it the Stamps be defaced, & it be treason to mill any more money in this Stamp, or to have instruments for that end; and all the unmilled half crownes thence forward to be decried and cease to be current or valuable any otherwise then as Bullion. For this will hasten all people to bring in their light money to the mint before the time for milling it be expired It would be easiest to mill all the money in the Tower as it comes into the Kings hands: but this will be long in doing & all the loss in milling would be the Kings. Tis better that a speedier end be put to clipping & that every man bear his own loss in coynage, then that the King beare the losse of the whole nation. I pass by other particulars of less moment as 1 whether every man shall carry his money to the Tower, or one or more new mints (for saving this carriage) be erected in others parts of the nation, & remain fixed there or be removed from city to city till the money be milled 2 Whether the half crowns which weigh more then 2s 2d or perhaps then 2s should be exempted from this coynage of light money & valued as Bullion & accordingly milled with that stamp which is now in use. 3 Whether the Shillings & sixpences shall be new milled at the same time with the half crowns & after the same method or let alone till another year, & if they be let alone whether for putting a limit to clipping them, those shillings & sixpences which are clipt within the ring shall all be new milled & decryed  together with the half crowns 4. Whether an Office should not be annexed to the Mint for refining base money (the platted brass by Quicksilver, & the silver of course allay by other due means) & what rules shall be observed in such an office."

Warden of his Majestys Mint within the Tower of London. Thomas Fowle one of the Clerkes of the said Mint humbly presents to your worship as follows That since his coming to the Mint which was about the 20th. of Iuly. 1672. Sir Anthony St. Leger then Warden of the Mint came very seldom to the place and did not anythin of service more then to come and Ask how the Affaires of the Mint were and that was all & soe went his way. After him one Sir Thomas Wharton Knight of the Bath and his sonn phillip men of plentifull fortunes joyntly was Warden, who sometimes came to the Mint and asked a few Questions relating there unto and did some Business and to little or no more purpose then the former Succeeded them did one Sir phillip Floyd a very Ingenious Gentleman a Civilian by proffession, one of the Clerks of the Councill and one of the secretarys to the then Earle of Danby Lord high Treasurer of England, who as Warden Assisted the Officers of the Mint in severall Affaires proper for the Wardens to the Lords of the Treasury who succeeded the said Earle of Danby and continued soe for the space of a twelve month & then dyed. Next to him came one Doctor Owen Wynn A learned Civilian and Chiefe Secretary to the Earle of Sunderland whose Attendance was frequently and Diligent and very servicable in his station & not long after his present Majestys Accession to the Crown relinquished his Employment. His successor was one Benja{e} Overton Esqr. who came from beyond sea with his Majesty as was reported, who came sometimes to the Mint & did some business now and then in a Transitory Manner and then went his way, who having his Majestys favour was made a Comissioner of the Customes and too left his Wardens place here. And now at present yourself in the Office of Warden, which if I may be soe bold to say and which submission I question not but wee shall find you fair to Exceed the rest for the good & priviledges of the Mint more then all your predecessors. It is further humbly shewn unto you that in the time of Sir Anthony St leger (the first Warden of the Mint since my being here) made his Sonn Anthony St. Leger Esqr. who was Ensigne to Sir Ino Robinson his Deputy and there being some who did worker or belong to the Mint Emprisoned for Debt and that within the power of Sir Ino: Robinson Application 
        
         <22r> 
        
        was made to this Ensigne St. leger and Deputy to the then Warden his father for preserving the priviledges of the Mint  to sett him at liberty; with said Ensigne St. Ledger and Deputy Warden went to St. Ino Robinson his Captain and Lieutenant of the Tower and demanded the prisoners Liberty, who reused to grant it whereupon the said St. Leger told Sir Ino. Robinson that he had nothing to doe with any thing that belonged to the Mint of that nature and would have him out whether he would or no and soe by Virtue of his power as Deputy Warden and priviledges of the Mint sett him at liberty From whom the said Fowle had this particularly it being soe long since has forgot. but is sure he had it from such a hand that Credit may be given to it Iames Hoare Esqr. late Comptroller of the Mint {deceased} was a very Indi{r}ious man, and though but of few wordes would appeare very much for the priviledges of the Mint, being sometimes free in discourse with the said Fowle would often be talking to him concerning the priviledges of the Mint & upon an Occasion told the said Fowle what papers between King Charles the second and Sir Ino: Robinson saying Sir Iohn you have nothing to doe with the 
        
        
         <22v> 
        
        Mint altho it be within the Tower between the beating of the Travally in the Morning & the Taptoo at Night, which said Relation the said Fowle had from the said Comptrollers own mouth or nere to this Effect. Henry Slingsby Esqr deceased late Master and Worker of the said Mint a man of great parts & understanding would not admitt the priviledges of the Mint in the least to be infringed or Warders to come within theMint by Virtue of their places to doe as they doe  now but would & did in a civil way permit them to come sometimes but not otherwise as aforesaid Sir Thomas Wharton (Sir Anthony St. leger's successor) upon application made to him by a Creditor of Mr. Dallows for that purpose gave leave to the said Creditor to Arrest him without ever asking or taking to his advise therein any of the Officers of the Mint, which he ought to have done according to the Constitution and Customes of the same, who lay in prison within the Tower by the space of three weekes. this the said Wharton did by Virtue of his power as Warden, which by the then Officers of the Mint (especially by the Comptroller) was
        
         <23r> 
        
        lookt upon as a rash and Inconsiderate Act of his lenging much to the Weakning the priviledges of the Mint The said Fowle coming late one Night to the Tower having been upon the Comptrollers business was Arrested and carried to the poulty counter, and being unwilling it should be known lay there that and the Night following and acquainted the Comptroller therewith who thereupon sent for the party aforesaid and asked him how he durst venture to arrest me that was soe much Concern'd in the Mint without first asking the Officers of the Mint leave, what other wordes passed between them the said Fowle knoweth not, but soe much he had from the parties own mouth, and further Found by his own relation that if he brought me not presently to the Comptroller he should stay and beare me Company, whereupon the aforesaid part was mighty earnest to gett me out and if I mistake not came along with me to the Comptroller whereupon all things were presently after settled"

But those seizures & forteitures for want of other rewards are either privately pocketed by my Agents or sold off to them that forfeit or where they come to my knowledge are ballanced & sunk by my Agents Bills & since the ceasing of the clipping trade suffice not to pay for the charge & pains of recovering & gathering them up, & are also a discouragement to Prosecutions by the Offence they give in Courts of Justice for being derived to me out of their ancient channel & by exposing me & my Agents to the censure of prosecuting men for the Estates so that the clipping & coyning trades instead of decreasing did in the time of my Predecessors grow to the greatest height. And the Coyners are now thinned in this City, yet by their flight from hence & by the turning of clippers to coyners, they seem more numerous in other places where I cannot reach them. And the new reward of forty pounds per head has now made Courts of Iustice & Iuries so averse from beleiving witnesses & Sheriffs so inclinable to impannel bad Iuries that my Agents & Witnesses are discouraged & tired out by the want of success & by the reproach of prosecuting & swearing for money. And this vilifying of my Agents & Witnesses is a reflexion upon me which has gravelled me & must in  time impair & perhaps wear out & ruin my credit. Besides that I am exposed to the calumnies of as many Coyners & Newgate Sollicitors as I examin or admit to talk with me if they can but find friends to beleive & encourage them in their false reports & oaths & combinations against me. I do not find that the prosecuting of Coyners was imposed upon any of my Predecessors (tho some of them have done it) or 
     <439r> is consistent with the the Privy Seale. For he that gathers up the estates of convicted criminals should not intermeddle with their prosecution. Nor is there any reward or encouragement appointed for my service in these matters, nor am I provided with any competent assistance to enable me to grapple with an undertaking so vexatious & dangerous as this must be whenever managed with diligence & sincerity.   Is. Newton Tis the business of an Attorney & belongs properly to ye Kings Attorney {&} Sollicitor General, & they are best able to go through it especially with such assistance as they  can procure.

The Workers (one of which is Master of the rest) are they who melt refine allay & run the standarded gold & silver into Ingots to be coyned. The Moneyers are they who flat out & coyn those Ingots into moneys. The other  Ministers are the Controller, Assaymaster, Surveyor of the Meltings, Clerk of the Irons,  Weigher & Teller, Auditor, Engraver, Porter: whereof the Controller, Assaymaster & Surveyor are, in behalf of the King & his people, a Cheque upon the Master & Worker in his Accounts, Assays, & Meltings. These other Ministers are standing Officers with constant salaries but the workers & Moneyers are no standing Officers nor have salaries but are allowed after a certain rate in the pound weight for all the moneys they make, excepting that the Master & Worker (that is he who is one of the Workers & the Master of the rest) did in the reign of King Charles the 2d become a standing Officer with a salary of 500℔ per annum which is greater then the Wardens salary, & soon after was appointed by Act of Parliament to receive the Coynage Duty, the distribution of which has brought the Mint into his power. For the Seigniorage or Revenue of the Mint was till then received of the King by the Warden. Also the last winter the Master & Worker was empowered by  a clause in another Act of Parliament to incorporate new Moneyers into the Mint without the Wardens consent & soon after formed a Project of erecting Mints in the Country without any Warden at all, & lately has rejected the Wardens judicial power by endeavouring to have differences referred to the Warden & himself. The Moneyers have also shook off the Wardens authority over them by feigning themselves a Corporation, & the Controller (who is the first of the other Ministers) by getting the Office of Master & Worker into his hands (tho an Office inconsistent with his own) hath equalled himself with the Master & Warden & this equality they have ratified by a new Law (no where written but in the Moneyers Charter) that all Orders made by the Master & Controller are binding even to the Warden himself. And thus the Wardens Authority which was designed to keep the thre{e} sorts of Ministers in their Duty to the King & his people, being baffled & re <9r> jected & thereby the Government of the Mint being in a manner dissolved those Ministers act as they please for turning the Mint to their several advantages.

The Scots ever since a treaty between them and the English in order to a union in the reign of King Iames the 1st have coyned their silver monies of the same standard with the English, vizt 11 ounces 2 penny weight fine & eighteen penny weight allay. For which end they have indented trial pieces sent from hence of the same plate with those made for the English Mint. The standard Troy weights by which they coyne are also made at our Mint at the same time with ours by common consent of both Mints and our pound Troy is greater then theirs by four penny weight and nine grains of ours. And as we divide our ounce Troy into 62 pence so they divide their ounce Troy into 62 shillings (for their shillings in this recconing answer to our pence) excepting that  in consideration of the charge of coynage and to prevent the melting down of their money, they make their money lighter by four shillings in  sixty (as I am informed:) so that 60 shillings of their money are to their ounce Troy as 56 to 62 or 28 to 31 and by consequence ought to weigh 4252031 grains (or 17dwt 172031gr) of our pound Troy (as I find by triall they do) & to be worth 55 English pence wanting the  48th part of a penny. The experiments we have made of the weight & fineness of their money are as follows. The two Mark the Mark and the half Mark pieces coyned before the year 1675 are bad work & considerably coarser then standard: for which reason they were called in neare the end of that reign and are no longer current. The sixty, forty twenty ten & five shillings-pieces coyned since are better money & make up the bulk of the money which now (viz anno 1697) comes out of Scotland. Those coyned in the reigns of King Iames & King William are well sized. Most of their money here examined is standard none too fine some too coarse so that one piece with another it may be recconed above an half penny weight worse then standard. The Scots now pay their shillings for our pence in the borders of Scotland & putt off our crown pieces for 65 & sometimes 66 of their shillings in Scotland (as I am credibly informed:) which being an advantage of 8 or 10 per cent has filled the borders of England with their money and Scotland with ours. And the carrying on of this trade hath or might have in time prompted them to melt down our money  & carry it to their Mint had not our enquiry into this matter now put an end to it by the Lords of the Treasury ordering the Receivers to refuse their money. If the Scotch money were all coyned of a just weight & Allay 11s 9d of such money would be worth 10d34 of ours. But considering that some pieces of their money are too light & others too course & that their money is more easily counterfeiters then ours, we may receive their 10s pieces for nine pences & their 5s pieces for four pence halfpennies & their Mark & half mark pieces (when ever they shall coyne any more) for shillings & six pences, and 
    
     <3r> 
    
    so proportionally of their other pieces of money. For these are round recconings fit for use and approach the true value of their money most nearly."

Vpon a contract between the Crown & the Master & Worker for the time being some Officers of the mint act in behalf of the Crown as cheques upon the Master to see that he performs his contract duty & others act under the Master for performing that contract. By the Indenture of the Mint the Warden pays the Salaries of the former  {&} the charges of the  Diets of the Officers & other necessary charges to be imployed in & about the making of the said moneys, or repairing of the Offices & Houses necessary to be imployed in the said service 
        
         <4v> 
 By the Act of 18 Car II entituled An Act for encouraging of Coynage the Salaries of the Officers of the Mint & the charges of providing maintaining & repairing  of the houses Offices & buildings &  other necessaries for assaying melting down & coyning  are limited to 3000li for preventing extravagance & the Overplus (for encouraging the coinage) is appropriated to the expence wast & charge of assaying meltign down & coyning, & buying in of Bullion to coyn. And in the clause preceding, these necessaries are called the charge or expence of the Mint, & the overplus is called the charge or expence of Assaying melting down & coyning & the encouragement of bringing in bullion. By the first I understand such necessaries for coining as may be limited without discouraging teh coynage by the  second such as  cannot, that is such as arise from the {being} of a coynage & increase or decrease therewith. The Act of Parliament reccons the  Houses Offices & buildings among the necessaries & the Indenture of the Mint  made at that time, adds the Diet, & allows 2600li per annum for the salaries & so leaves only  400li for the buildings Diet & other necessary provisions whereby the Master may be enabled to carry on the coinage. Vpon a contract by Indenture between the Crown & the Master & Worker for the time being, some Officers of the Mint act in behalf of the  crown as cheques upon the Master to see that he performs his  contract duly & others act under him for performing that contract. And by the Indenture the Warden pays the Salaries of the former & the charges of the repairs & of the  Diet of the Officers & other necessary charges to be imployed in & about the making of the moneys & repairing of the Offices & Houses necessary to be imployed in the said service. There are the necessaries within the 3000li. And the Master pays the Moneyers By the Indenture of the Mint the Warden pays the Salaries of the former, & the charges of the Diet of the Officers & other necessary charges to be imployed  in & about the making of the said moneys or repairing of ht e Offices & Houses necessary to be imployed in the said service. And the Master pays the Moneyers 912 per pound weight of silver & 3s 6d per pound weight of Gold for drawing cutting flatting  sizing  marking & coyning the same & for all their labour wast & expence therein & for keeping in repair all  the Rollers & Instruments to cut flatten make round & size  the pieces  & mark them on the edges & all other tools Engins & instruments amongst which are the Mills & the scales & weights & vices & files for sizing.  But the wooden work of the  Mills Presses & Cutters & the Nealing & blanching furnaces & the furnaces in the melting houses are repaired by the direction of the Master & the charges therof are placed in his Account according to the {Laws} of the Mint. And so are all the charges of Assaying,  (vizt in charcoal, Aqua fortis, watersilver, lead, furnaces  Cuppels,) & the charges of reducing the silver to standard by  refineing & allay.  All these charges are paid by the Master out of the surplus above the 3000li; vizt the charges of repairing the Mills Presses & other coyning tools & those of reducing the Bullion to standard  by vertue of certain clauses of the Indenture, & those of Assaying by vertue of a clause of the coynage Act.  The wooden work of the Mills Presses &  Flatters may be considered as belonging to the coyning Tools. The Assay furnace is a moveable engin m{a}de of copper plates. The other furnaces are distinguished from the bu{il}dings in being under the Masters direct. He erects repairs  removes & rebuilds them without medling with the  buildings or asking te consent or leave of the other Officers & he places the charges of repairing them in his own Account according to the course of the Mint while the charges of repairing the buildings are placed in the Wardens Account. And the reason of this distinction seems to be that the  Master may be enabled to dispatch the coynage & make delivery with all convenient speed  according to his covenants without staying for the  consent or order of the other Officers or being retarded by the want of money, while the salaries of the Officers & the charges of repairs & necessaries in the Wardens Account are limited to 3000li for preventing extravagance. And by this means the Warden & master are enabled to make up their Accounts severally without depending upon one another. If any doubt arise about   any custome or course of the Mint, the custome not being contrary to  Act of Parliament is made a law by the following clause of the Indenture of the Mint. And that the said Master & Worker shall upon his Account yearly to be made of his Receipts payments charges & disbursments before the Auditors of the Mint or Mints for the time being have full allowance defalc{ati}on & discharge of & for all such summ & summs of money as he shall duly pay & disburse according to the true intent & meaning of the above recited Letters patents & according to the directions hereafter in these presents expressed, & according to the course of the said Mint or Mints respectively, as by the same Acts of Parliament is directed & appointed The Master & Worker also as Treasurer of the Mint pays the fees at the Exchequer & Treasury upon received the Coynage money & those  for passing the Accounts through  the several Offices  of the exchequer.  He pays also the charges of trying the Pix & the fees for entring the Report of the Iury, & for summoning them. The Pix is tried by the Assay & the charges there{of} belong to that head.  But the charges of the Dinner for the Iury being too great to  come within the 3000li, have been hitherto paid out of the civil List.  The particulars  of the Masters Account  for the year 1712 are as follows The furnaces were necessary to be repaired for carrying on the coynage & the charges thereof & those of hte Assay ffice & of reducing the moneybullion t standard w{illeg}  free from extravagance & {illeg} legal & necessary for encouraging the coynage & the fees at the Exchequer Treasury & other Officers were necessary to be paid  & all these expences are placed in my Account according to the course of the Mint &  the Vouchers are good & therefore all these charges are I think to be allowed by the Article of the Indenture above recited. And the Warden is to discharge himself of what has been imprest to him & in his next Account to charge himself with the surplus if any there be. The salary of 40li to the Wardens second Clerk is now ceased, but in its stead the charges of the dinner of the Iury at the last trial of the Pix  amounting to about 92li will come into the next years Account"

The weight 12 is about 16 or 20 grains more or less as he pleases to have his weights made. With this he weighs the silver into the fire & recconning a wast answering to two penny weight he weighs it out of the fire by the weight 11 to see if it be standard, & if it be heavier or lighter he adds in the lighter scale penny weights & if need be an half penny weight & grains to see how much it is better or wors. His scales turn with the 128th part of a grain, that is with the 2560th part of the weight 12 which answers to less then the 10th part of a penny weight. They are fenced about with glass windows to keep them from the motion of the air & have in them little thin brass platters to take away the weights by without handling the scales. He cuts off from every Ingot a piece of about a drachm for two assays beats it out into a thin plate, scrapes it clean & cutts it into the ballance &c. In assaying the money he clips a little off from severall pieces of money & assays them together. The Assaydrops of the money & of the pott-assays (but not of the Ingots) are his fee. He makes two assays of every ingot, puts 13 Coppels at once into the furnace uses the poorest lead  assayd  & run into bullets. A bullet istwice the weight of the silver. He foliates a bullet with the hammer; tears it in two, wrap{s} up the silver in one half, & adds a whole bullet to it, so that the lead is 3 to one
        He lets the fire cool gradually till the silver set least by cooling too quickly the silver spring & the assay thereby make the silver seem wors then it is. When the lead is blown off the silver looks very bright. The Assay Furnace is of copper plates luted half an inch thick within. It is about 18 inches squar{e} 10 inches high to the grate (which is of iron barrs) & about 15 inches above the grate. The muffle stands upon the grate & the coppels are set in with a pair of tongues upon the floor of the grate through a round hole in the side of the Furnace which is afterwards filled with live charcoal. In a quarter of an hour the lead fume{s} away & the operation is done. The King pays for the muffles coppells & furnaces. Pottern ore is the poorest of silver & steel ore & otherthe poorest sorts of ores are the richest in silvers.          commends the Lead of Villach as best for Assays because poorest in silver.  The Melter runns from 600 or 700 to 800℔ & of late 1000℔ weight of silver in a pot & melts 3 potts a day in each furnace within the space of about 12 or 14 hours. The first pot is about 5 hours on the fire the two next about 4 hours a piece. When the silver is molten he puts in the allay. For each melting  (including fire, pots, Hoops tongues shovels ladles ingot molds sand & wages of melters & mould makers) he is allowed three farthings per pound weight & for wast five farthings & as much for melting the scissel & for its wast, that is in all 4d per poundweight(vizt 2d for  Ingots & 2d for the scissel Formerly he had only 312 per poundweight for ☾ & 1s 1d per poundweight for ☉. The sweep he has into the bargain & makes it up for himself at his own charges. A pot for 8{00} weighs about 500℔wt & cost 20d per pound, and lasts about  six weeks or  two months   more or less that is about 120 meltings so that pots cost about 18d per poundweight of silver melted in them & if hoops ingots molds & other utensils  {saved} be added they cost less then 16d per poundweight. A pot in three meltings each day  spends about 25 bushalls of coales per diem, & imploys about 10 men at 20d. per diem each in making molds. looking to the fire & filling & ladling out the potts. The mens wages & coals at 6d per Bushel to 16 per ℔wt or something less. The sweep amounts to          & the charge of making it up to             per poundweight. And the coales at 6d per Bushel to about 116 of a penny per poundweight. The Pots shrink in the fire by long use so that a Pott which when new holds 800lwt, when it has been used a month or six weeks will hold but 700 or 650lwt, or perhaps less. The Scissel if the Pot is crouded full & well charged a 2d & 3d time wasts as little (or without a sensible difference) as if it be filled with Ingots, & the three meltings (if the pot be not quite so full) are done in the same time or within a little.  The hammered money was melted last year at the Exchequer with a blast in small  potts of 50℔ weight a piece, 75℔ weight of money in a pott, about 12 pot fulls each day. The potts cost 8 pence a pound & last about 30 or 35 meltings or potfulls a piece. So that the potts cost 16 of a penny per lwt of silver melted in them. But the blast makes quicker dispatch this way with perhaps less then half the expence of fire then in the other way with great pots. The little pots are best for coarse silver to be refined, the great ones for standard silver because they alter the fineness least & make least wast for the melter. Mr Floyer & Mr Shales were payd 34d per poundweight for melting at the Exchequer this Winter besides potts (which  weighed about 50℔ per pott, cost 8d per pound of iron or 17d per poundweight of money melted in them) & Refitting of Ingots Mittens for workmen, earthen potts, sandover, baskets cartage of potts &c (which cost  about 170 of a penny per poundweight or 110 of the potts) but the potts &c should{illeg} be included in the 34d for melting.

     <11r> day takes up a bushel of coals or above in the first melting  each mor{ning} & half a bushel or less in the rest, that is about 712 o{f}a bushel {ea}{at ea}ch melting at a mean rate, that is if coale be 6d a {bush}el, about 120th of a penny per poundweight. The wast {at}the first melting of hammered money with the blast in these little potts is recconn{ed} at 2d (or 23 dwt) per poundweight, the sweep being allowed for in this recconning & estimated at a farthing per poundweight. The Plate taken in at Chester last May proved generally about 5dwt or 6dwt (per poundweight) worse then standard (by reason of the soader) with a wast of about 5 ounces per wt or 1dwt per poundweight  Of the making the Moneys Sixteen ounces Troy of sixpenny Blanks were blancht in 6 minutes & lost of their weight in blanching the first experiment 8gr the next 10gr the next 7gr the next 9gr & at a second blanching for 7 minutes of time one grain more at a middle recconning they lost at one blanching 812 grains. Whence a pound Troy loses about 613 grains & a pound Troy of crown blancks 3gr of 12 crown blancks 4gr & of shilling blancks 5gr. By experiment I found that a pound Troy of 12 crown blancks lost 312 grains. A sixpenny barr weighing 16 ounces Troy  in Nealing three times, got 3 grains in weight the first time, lost 12 a grain the second time & got 112 grain the third time, that is in all the three nealings it grew heavier by 4 grains. A shilling barr of 15 ounces Troy in one nealing grew heavier by 112 grain. So that Nealing increases the weight of a shilling barr of a pound weight Troy by about 1gr or 114gr & of a sixpenny barr by about 112 or 2gr. And Nealing & blanching together decrease the weight of a pound weight of sixpenny blancks by about 5gr, of shilling blancks by 4gr, of 12 crown blancks 3gr of crown blancks 213 grains. And if the sixpenny, twelvepenny, half crown & crown blancks be taken in common in the proportion of 1, 4, 3, 2 the nealing & blanching together decrease the weight of a poundweight by 
        5 + 16 + 9 + 42310
342310 or 312gr. If the blancks be not well nealed they will not blanch well. The Moneyers melt their limel per se without any mixture to make it run & in melting it grows better 2dwt 3dwt or 4dwt & loses 1, 2 or 3 poundweight of its weight The limel is not above the 1100th part of the money. And if the loss in the limel be 180th part thereof by scattering & 180th by melting, the wast by the limel will be 14000th of the money that is 316 of a penny per poundweight There is also a wast in the milling by the dripping off of sand with some particles which of silver & in the nealing by some blanks falling out of the pan upon the hearth & lying there till they be half consumed by {the} fire and in shreds {illeg} of silver scattered up & down the rooms & lost in the {dus}t or by sticking to the workmens shoes: all which cannot amount to 14 of a penny per poundweight. So that the whole wast in the making of the moneys by the Moneyers comes not to 1d per poundweight. Two Mills with 4 Millers, 12 horses two Horskeepers, 3 Cutters, 2 Flatters, 8 sizers One Nealer,  three Blanchers, two Markers, two Presses with  fourteen labourers  to pull at them  can coyn after the rate of  a thousand weight or 3000℔ of money per diem And if for the horses & labourers one with another be allowed after the rates of 22d per diem  it comes to about 3℔ per diem, that is  three farthings per  poundweight. So that the whole charge of coynage besides the allowance to the moneyers for their hazzard & pains comes only to about 1d1218."

The Mint or Change is by the Charter thereof a Corporation consisting of the Warden, the Workers the Moneyers & the other Ministers. It may buy & sell, sue & be sued, & tis free from Taxes, arrests & servitude in forreign offices & imployments unless where the Charter is over-ruled by Act of Parliament. The Warden or Keeper of the Changes is by the Charter a Magistrate appointed to do right & justice among the Workers,  Moneyers & other Ministers in all their complaints & differences except in causes of freehold & causes relating to the crown & may call a Court. And hence it is that the Mints are free from arrests. Standing Orders are made by him the Master & Controller (as a Court or Board) or by any two of them whereof he to be one. Hence Letters from the Treasury are directed to them & sometimes to them by name & to the rest of the Officers in generall. In some things (as about the buildings & assays &c) the Assaymaster may be also called to the consult. For the Warden pays the Charges of necessary repairs first avouched by the Master Controller & Assaymaster or any two of them whereof the Master to be one. He supervises the whole process of the Coynage & pays the charges thereof & the salaries of the Officers except the Masters salary & wages & such salaries & wages as are appointed to be paid by the Master all which were received of the King & paid to the Officers & Workmen by the Warden before the enacting of the coynage duty, but now the Master retains out of that duty what the Warden should otherwise pay to him. With the consent of the General of the Mint of Scotland the Warden makes the standard weights of England & Scotland. He keeps an Indented trial piece to examin the assays by as oft as he shall think convenient, & the Master keeps another to make the moneys by. He is of late impowered to demand & receive the forfeited estates of abusers of the coyn for defraying the charges of them that prosecute. The Workers are the Master & his Assaymaster & Melter & Refiner with their Assistants Clerks & Vnderworkmen. The Master upon new occasions of coynage contracts with the King by Indenture & according to the Indenture by the assistance of his aforesaid servants receives, melts, refines, assays, rates & standards the gold & silver to be coyned, sets it out to the Potts runns it into standard barrs,  delivers those barrs by weight to the Moneyers & after coynage receives it from them & delivers it to the Importer by weight, & by his Clerks enters the accounts thereof in Day-books, Leger-books, Melting books, Pott-books & books of Debtor & Creditor. The Moneyers draw, cut out, size, blanch, edge & coyne 
     <2v> those Barrs into moneys & return the moneys scissel & brokage back to the Master by weight. They may not pay or distribute any moneys unassayd upon pain of forfeiting their franchises & bodies to prison. They take apprentices & form themselves into a company by electing one their number to be their Provost. They live in the Country & are bound to attend & do their  work whenever summoned by the Warden Master or Controller upon pain of losing their Franchises & bodies to prison. They are to work in such tasks & so many hours every day (sundays only excepted) as shall be appointed by the Master & for wilfull neglect or refusall the Warden Master & Controller (that is the Court) may expell or otherwise punish them (or any other workmen) as shall seem meet for their Majesties service, & by the same power (as in all other Corporations) may grant freedom to new Moneyers. The other Ministers are the Controller, Kings Assaymaster Surveyor of the Meltings, Weigher & Teller, King's Clerk, Clerk of the Irons &c. These are standing Officers with set salaries to cheque the Moneyers & Workers & see that they do their duty in working & coyning the gold & silver: the Workers & Moneyers (except the Master since the reign of Charles II) are not standing Officers nor have salaries but as workmen receive wages after a certain rate in the pound weight for all the gold & silver they work & coyne. The Controller is in behalf of the King a cheque upon the Master in his accounts & upon the Assaymasters in their assays. He makes a Controllment Roll upon oath every year of all the bullion molten with its allay & of all the moneys coyned monthly & supervises the whole coynage, & with the Warden & Master locks up the bullion & new coyned moneys & the Pix & Coynage duty: in doing which the Warden & Controller are a guard upon the Masters bullion & rent moneys & Pix & the Master & Controller are a guard upon the Coynage duty to be issued out by the Warden according to ancient custome The Assaymaster is in behalf of the King a cheque upon the Master for his assays & keeps a book of all the gold & silver as to quantity & fineness & of all the Pot-assays. He & the Warden & Controller or any two of them chuse the ingot for the Pot assay; & when the money is coyned he tries it both in weight & fineness before the Warden (who then chuses out the assay-pieces & pix) & the Master  & Controller, & if it prove without  <3r> remedy the Master bears the loss of remelting it. When the Importer & Master disagree about the price of bullion the Assaymaster in the presence of the Warden Master & Controller assays the same & the Master then receives it & stands charged with it according to the report of the Assaymaster who is a sworn officer. The assay may be made by the Wardens Indented triall piece. The Surveyor of the meltings is in behalf of the King a cheque upon the Melter to see that the gold & silver & its allay & nothing else be put into the Melting pott. Whenever the Pot is opened he watches that nothing unfit be put into it & when it is laded out he sees that the  ingot for the Pott-assay be duly taken & carried to the Assay-office. He keeps a book of all the gold & silver molten & of the allay put into it. The Weigher & Teller weighs all the gold & silver brought into the Office of Receipt either before or after coynage & when tis requisite he tells it there. He weighs the silver moneys by Iourneys of 60 pound weight & the gold by journey of 15 The Kings Clerk registers the papers which pass between the Treasury & the Mint. Also he & the Warden & Controller (by their Clerks) or two of them, in behalf of the King rate & standard all the gold & silver brought into the Mint & examin the Pots set out by the Master, & enter these accounts in Day-books, Leger-books & Melting books. The Clerk of the Irons is at present the same person with the Surveyor of the meltings. He keeps an account of all the Dyes made & hardened by the Smith & when they are worn out sees them defaced in the presence of the Warden Master & Controller. He now keeps an account of all the Dyes  that are sunck & for that end has one of the keys to the great Press & to the box of Puncheons. There are also two Auditors who yearly examin & allow the accounts of the Warden & Master & the Controllment Roll a Clerk of the papers who may register Orders, Contracts, Patents Deputations, Controllment Rolls, Accounts audited &c a Porter who removes the Ingots of gold & silver from Office to Office; & an Engraver, two Engineers & a Smith who make & repair the Puncheons, Dyes, Engins & other iron work & are immediately under the Master. The Warden Master & Controller or any of them as often as need shall require may take up at his Majesties price Gravers Smiths Workmen & Labourers & other necessaries for making the irons and moneys & doing all manner of business & therein all Mayors, Sheriffs Bayliffs & other Officers are commanded to assist the said Officers of the Mint."

May it please your Lordships  We the Warden Master Worker & Controller of his Majesties Mints do most humbly represent that  by our Charter confirmed by many Kings for above five hundred years past all the Officers Workers Moneyers & other Ministers of the Mints are incorporated throughout all England into one body under the Government of a Warden with freedome from Arrests & other great Privileges {&} without subjection of our Corporation to the particular Government or Iurisdiction of the Tower of London or its liberties. And that the Kings of England have given us the ground & houses between the Lines in the said Tower  out of their royal favour & for our greater security & not to deprive us of those their other royal grants above mentioned & bring us into subjection trouble {&} danger . And also that his Majesty by the Indenture  of the Mint doth will & streightly charge all officers of the Tower that all the Officers of the Mint & their servants & all importers of gold & silver shall have free ingress & regress & issue by the Gates & through the same Tower & Franchises thereof inward & outward at all times without any arresting disturbance letting or gainsaying of the chief Governour Co{ns}table Lieuetenant or the Porter or any other Officer or Person whatsoever he be for any manner of debt matter or cause whatsoever it be & without any thing given to any of them or to any other to have such entry or issue. And we further represent to your Lordships that we have at all times in every thing shewed due respect to my Lord Lucas as chief Governour of the Tower  And therefore we are concerned that we should be now forced to represent to your Lordships that on Satturday the third Instant, Philip Atherton one of our Labourers was apprehended in our Melting house   without the licence or knowledge of our Warden by Roger Bayly a Constable by virtue of a Warrant of Robert Bateman Esqr one of his Majesties Iustices of the Peace for the Liberties of the Tower backt with another Warrant of my Lord Lucas & is now detained in New Prison from the Kings service. And that on the same day one of the Warders, to let out of the Mint some people which he had brought in, seized the Gate of the Mint & took the Porters son by the throat; whence arose a fray between them which caused such a tumultuous concourse of people as rendred the money unsafe which was then coming down the street of the Mint in Trays & that the said Warder threatens revenge upon the Porters son wherever 
    he meets him & my Lord Lucas himself threatens further  (notwithstanding his Majesties  will &  command to the contrary exprest in the Charter & Indenture of the Mint) to 
     <409v> sue our Porter for the same,  And we further represent to your Lordships that {t}he Centinals lately appointed to guard the door of the Engravers working room where the Dies & Puncheons  were seized & kept by the Warden had orders to permit entrance as well to my Lord Lucas as to the Warden And that our Engraver Mr Harris having sollicited my Lord to turn Mr Roettiers family out of the Mint & my Lord having divers times prest the Warden to do it & threatned to apprehend Mr Iames Roettiers & at length an Information being made  that King Iames was the{re}{n} seen in Mr Roettiers House, My Lord did thereupon seize the Gates of the Mint & search Mr Roettiers house two several days without giving notice to any Officer of the Mint of his intended search, & now demands a list of the names of all persons belonging to the Mint, in order to search their houses at pleasure, under pretence that they entertein such lodgers as belong not to the Mint & are dangerous to the Tower. Where as his Majesty by the Indenture of the Mint places in  us the care of enquiring after such as live or inhabit in the Mint without our licence or other right & impowers us to turn them out, & military searches without us have not hitherto been used so far as we know, nor are necessary to the safety of the Tower the Mint being shut up on all sides by the Lines & we being ready to search either alone or with his Lordship upon notice of any danger, & if military searches without us should be now allowed & Constables let in upon us at pleasure we cannot undertake any longer the charge of the Dyes & Puncheons & Marking Engins & other coyning Tools & of the Gold & Silver which lyes scattered about in all the rooms apperteining to the coynage, nor  will Merchants & other Importers think their estates secure in the Mint.  We were placed in a Garrison not that the Exchange {&} Treasury of the Nation might not be invaded by {our} Guards but guarded in our custody from all manner of invasion. And we further represent that the Centi{nals} begin to be rather a grievance then security to us. The Press-room about a fortnight ago was in danger of being robbed one of the Locks of the door being broken, which makes a suspicion that the Centinal was at {leas}tprivy to it, so that the Moneyers are now fain to lodge two Labourers in the Press room for their security which they never thought necessary to do before. And about the same time two of our houses being greatly disturbed at Midnight by a drunken Officer upon the Guards who drew his sword brake the window & would have forced himself into one of the houses & running after one of our servants made a pass at him & ran him through the cloaths & a Centinal being called either to come to their assistance or to call his Corporall with a File of Musketeers, the Centinal would not stirnor call. And when a Corporal & File of Musketeers were called by another person, the  endeavoured to perswade a by-stander to beare false witness for turning the blame upon our men. And my Lord Lucas instead of being told the truth of such matters is only informed by the soldiers that our men get drunk & affront the Centinals, &  has upon such informations ordered the Centinals to fire at us. Whereas heretofore the Centinals used not to be set singly as now, but to walk the Mint-street all night in a body strong enough to apprehend any drunken or  <410r> disorderly person without firing at him.  For why should we lose a good Artificer upon pretence of his being drunk, when the best are most addicted to that crime & it was never yet made death? Or why should every Centinal be impowered under any feigned pretence to shoot his enemy or any other man that complains, if such bloody discipline may safely be avoyded? Or why should the people who live in the Mint be so terrified as  to leave their habitations in it to the neglect of the Kings service & insecurity of the treasure. And we are further constrained to represent that the Warden on thursday last  telling my Lord Lucas the misdemeanours committed in the Mint by this drunken Officer, his Lordship & the Deputy Governour together did the next day being Friday give strict charge to his Warders not to suffer either meat or drink to be brought into the Tower to workmen in the Melting-house or Press-room, & that if any were sent for, they should take it away from the messengers & give it to the soldiers, his Lordship pretending that the workmen abuse the same to excess & sell it to others, (which we never heard of) & that his Warders have an unreasonable trouble in examining persons that go in & out.. And this  order being strictly put in execution gave so great discontent to the workmen, that but for the perswasion of the Officers of the Mint they would have left off their work that day & the two next days  instead of  nine potts were not able to melt above six  & say they  can work no more unless they may have speedy redress.  And we are further to acquaint your Lordships that my Lord Lucas represents that he doth not invade the Privileges of the Mint but that the power which he useth over us is asserted by ancient Records & Court Rolls preserved in the Tower,  All which we most humbly desire your Lordships according to your great wisdomes to take into serious consideration in order to our releife & pray that  the Records & Court Rolls alledged by  his Lordship  may be produced & compared with our Charter & Indenture  & the rights between the Tower & the Mint thence adjusted stated & limited so that both parties may know their Duties Privileges & Powers in respect of each other for conserving a good correspondence & friendship between  them for the future & that what has hitherto  by mistake been done against us may not be drawn into precedent hereafter."

Sheweth That your Petitioner did in the last sessions of Parliament1 discover several abuses committed in the Mint &2 shewed by what methods false money was coyned,3 that laws might more effectually be made  to prevent the same & severall Acts were accordingly made against it, &4 then some of the Mint threatned by some means to prosecute him & take away his life before the next sessions of Parliament,5 telling him that this Honourable House had no power to meddle with the affairs of the Mint. therefore they would not obey the Order made by a Committee of this Honourable House That the said Committee5 promised your Petitioner he should suffer no dammage for his discoveries about the Mint & by the directions of this Honourable House a member thereof did represent his case to the King & his Majesty was pleased to say that he should suffer no dammage for the said matters, yet they committed him to Newgate & kept him in Irons for seven weeks alledging that he had abused the Mint in Parliament & they did falsly & illegally preferr a bill of Indictment against him but could bring no evidence against him to prove it altho they used strange methods to procure something.  For many witnesses have made oath before a Iudge of the Kings Bench & some Iustices of  peace, that some of the Mint have imployed & given Privilege to several persons to coyn false money who put it away among the subjects for good all which was done with an intent to draw him into coyning to take his life away & the better to effect the same they allowed the said persons money from time to time to buy tools & to carry on the said conspiracy against your  Petitioners life. But all their endeavours could not get him to be concerned in coyning, but on the contrary he hath made it his business for a considerable time past to find out the Treasons & Conspiracies against the King & Kingdome & thereby hath discovered many who have been convicted for the same, & was this year writing a book of the present state of the Mint & the defects thereof (as he promised the said Committee) which he hoped would have been of service to the publick. But the Mint having notice of it they committed him to {Newgate} Prison & so prevented him from doing it. All which can be proved if this honourable House is pleased to require it. That your Petitioner is utterly ruined by his endeavours to serve the King & Kingdom & by his discoveries against the Mint to this Honourable House Your Petitioner therefore most humbly plays that this Honourable House will be pleased to consider his great sufferings & ruined condition as being incapable of providing for himself & family by what he intended for the service of the Publick & grant him such redress as shall seem best in your Honours great Wisdom & Iustice And your Petitioner shall ever pray &c Wm Chaloner An Answer to Mr Chaloner's Petition. Mr Chaloner before a Committee of the last sessions of Parliament laboured to accuse & vilify the Mint & approve himself a more skilfull coyner then they that he might be made their supervisor & then supply Tho. Holloway with Tools out of the Tower to counterfeit his own milled money by a way which he then concealed from that Honourable Committee, boasting secretly that he would fun the  Parliament as he had done the King & Bank before. And while he was upon this designe I gave the Chairman of that Honourable Committee minutes for a new Act of Parliament against Coyners & the Act was afterwards drawn up by some of the Iudges & Officers of the Mint & brought into the House of Lords without Mr Chaloners assistance. About the end of that Sessions Mr Neale (as I have heard) moved the House to give leave that Mr Chaloner might be prosecuted for taxing the Mint with coyning great quantities of false money but I do not know that there was any designe or menace to prosecute him for anything else then that calumny & much less to take away his life. Nor did I ever hear any one pretend that the Honourable House of Commons had no power to meddle with the Affairs of the Mint or that their Committee which then sat had not all the power which the House thought fit to give them: but when the Committee sent an order to me about preparing an Edger for Mr Chaloner to grove new money, I told Mr Chaloner that in regard of an Oath which I had taken I could not safely carry him to the Workmen of the Mint about it, but if he would give me directions I would take care of the matter; but Mr Chaloner refusing to give me directions (as he ought to have done by that Order I directed the workmen (without him) to grove some half crowns shillings & sixpences & carried them to the Committee. That his Majesty by order of this Honourable House was now moved in behalf of Mr Chaloner I did not hear till after I had committed him which I  was moved to do because he stood charged with new designes of counterfeiting Bills & Money forreign & domestick. And particularly upon the rising of the last sessions of Parliament he advised Tho. Holloway to take a house in the Country convenient for coyning & agreed with him that he should find materials & teach Holloway to coyn & Holloway & his brother Iohn should coyn together at that house & they three should share the money so made. And accordingly Tho. Holloway did take a house at Egham in Surrey & Chaloner did make some progress in teaching him & his brother & in preparing coyning tools, & for doing this & having coyned very great summs of Gold & not for offending the Mint he was committed & prosecuted. But the principal witness fled into Scotland & the Indictment being drawn wrong two others of the Witnesses were afterwards  <498r> drawn off to swear against it & against the Mint, altho by swearing on both sides their credit fell & to draw off the Kings witnesses &  swear them against the King gravells prosecutions & renders it dangerous for any man to prosecute & is therefore accounted a misdemeanour. There are divers witnesses that Mr Chaloner last spring & Summer was forward to coyn & I do not know or beleieve that any privilege or direction was given by any of the Mint to draw him or his confederates in or that any conspiracy was made against him or any money given to buy coyning tools. Neither can I find that he did ever make it his business to find out any treasons or conspiracies against the King & Kingdom but what were of his own contriving, as in the case of the Printers. And as for his intended book about the Mint I heard nothing of it till I saw it mentioned in his printed case & therefore did not commit him for that book. When I had committed him he told me he had written a book about preventing the counterfeiting of Bills & offered to let me see it, but said nothing of any book intended by him about the Mint. If therefore he be ruined tis by his endeavouring not to serve the King & Government as he pretends but to coyn false money. And if he would but let the money & Government alone & return to his trade of Japanning, he is not so far ruined but that he may still live as well as he did seven years ago when he left of that trade & raised himself by coyning."

A history of Chaloner's crimes since 1690, largely summarising the confessions of other coiners.","Chaloner's Case  [1]1. About seven years ago Chaloner was a poor man, a Iapanner in cloaths thredbare ragged & daubed with colours & then got stamps made by Taylor left of his trade turned coyner & in a short time put on the habit of a Gentleman took a great house at Kinghtsbridge & bought some plate. [2]2 He was originally taught to coyn by Coffee  & learnt all his art of him & Grosvener & at that time (which was seven years ago) put in a stock with Coffee for French Pistols which were conveyed into France by a Gentleman to put into the Kings treasury & also bought by Blackford Coppinger Peck Holloway Iones Carter & many others here & continued this trade with Coffee till about 512 years ago. [3]3. He was arrested by Taylor an Engraver in Grays Inn Lane in making a pair of French Pistol Dyes 1690 & another pair 1691 & a pair of Guinea Dyes of K. Ch. II 1692 & tried the Dyes before Taylor & raised himself by coyning 17000 Pistols & a great number of Guineas all of silver guilt. [4]Tho. Holloway hath had at least a 1000 of Chaloners French Pistols & paid him & his Mrs for them He hath also seen many 100ds of his Guineas & had almost an hundred in a day. He paid Chaloner 11s for a Guinea or Pistol & sometimes but 10s or 9s, & hath heard Chaloner own that he struck some of them & boast his workmanship & hath seen the Guinea Dyes in Chaloners hands [5]4 About 512 years ago Blackford being condemned for putting off Chaloners Guineas against Chaloner for making many thousand Guineas & French Pistols & was reprieved for some months, & Chaloner withdrew till Blackford was executed & while Blackford was in prison carried to Tho. Holloways house in the Friars a pair of K. Iames Guinea stamps & materials & cut out blancks for Guineas but being in danger to be apprehended by one {illeg} Tuccar fled & within 2 or 3 days he & Carter coyned in Westminster sixty Guineas. [6]6 Chaloner coyned Guineas about 3 years ago & continued to coyn them for the Holloways till about May  was two years. [7] [8]5 Soon after the execution of Blackford a great number of K. Iames's Declarations were scattered about the streets & Chaloner to secure himself as a person serviceable to the Government, perswaded Butler & Newbolt (at the expence of several treats & some money) to print him 40 of those Declarations pretending that they were not to be dispersed but sent to a private Gentleman in the Country as soon as he had got the papers he went to Secretary Tre{n}chard & informed him that he had discovered & taken the Printer of King Iames's Declarations with their Press & receiving (as he gives out) a reward of a 1000℔ has since braggd that he fun'd (that is trick't) the King of a 1000.[9] [10]7 A little before May was two years,  he & some others clipt & filed old hammered money at Mr Sampsons 
        in a little Alley in Drury Lane leading into Wild street. And about the same time Gravener & his wife & Carter by the consent of Chaloner coyned at Gravener's house about 60 pounds in half crowns with a pair of stamps made by Chaloner, & Chaloner sent Tho Holloway thither to see them work & learn the art & take away the stamps. And then Holloway coynd for Chaloner & Gravener who found materials & got the silver flatted & shared the profit. [11]These stamps Eliz. Holloway hath seen in Chaloners hands in  Gillinghams house & heard him say that he made them himself & commend then for fine things & received of her husband & he of Chaloners 12 crowns made with those stamps, as she knew by the form. And after her husbands hands she hath heard him rally at her husband for them & ask to have them again. [12]And about 112 year ago Iohn Holloway (who hath also heard Chaloner commend them) hid them in Essex in Mr Sammonds Wa{rren} at Kilden Hatch. [13]About May was two years Chaloner was accused face to face by Coppinger before the then Lord Mayor Sir Tho. Stamp & sent to Newgate but saved himself by getting Coppinger hangd out of the way. [14]Soon after to regain the favour of the Government he discovered the plot of cheating the Bank by Orphans Bills cut out of the check book of tilles in the Chamber of London, &  received of the Bank 200℔ for a reward [15]And that winter, a litle before the recoynage of the money he clipt old hammered money. [16]And soon after was in trouble again on account of a K. W. & Q. M. Di taken out of the Tower [17]And the summer following  that he might have a spy upon the Warden of the Mint for his own safety recommended to him his intimate friend & fellow coyner J. H. as a person that could do the Government the greatest service by taking up clippers & coyners. [18]And till about Feb or March following  he & Clark who keeps the Flask Tavern by Charing Cross  had a Press at Chiswick for coyning Guineas & other Gold moneys & imployed an Alehousekeeper of Kings-street Westminster to coyn there. Mrs Labree hath seen their work & saith it holds touch & weight & that the Dies are very fine ones of Chaloners making. About the same time he shewed before a Committee of Parliament some experiments of diminishing & counterfeiting milled money to convince them how easy it was to be done & how the money should be gr{oov}ed & coyned high to prevent those abuses, but amongst his confidents talkt[19]  of funning the Parliament & in conclusion represented all the Mint very unskilfull in comparison of himself that he might be made their supervisor, & told T. Holloway that he  would then supply him with coyning tools out oth' Tower & teach him how to  coyn with blanks hereafter mentioned which being soft would easily rise. [20] In the mean time vizt about the 10th or 11th of March last he desired H. Ha      to cast him a stamp for a shilling, for his money grew short & if the Parliament did not give him encouragement, he must go to work again. [21]After the end of that Sessions of Parliament when Mr Chaloner found himself disappointed of preferment he advised Tho. Holloway to take a convenient house for coyning & agreed with him that he & his brother Iohn Holloway should coyn together there & Chaloner should teach them a new way  quick & profitable & find materials & receive their work & they three should share the profit & accordingly Holloway did take a house about 20 miles off at Egham in Surrey, & did make some progress in teaching the brothers & particularly Tho. Holloway the Art [22]For Chaloner ordered him to get two brasses cast by a wooden pattern which he received of Chaloner & shewed me & he did get two brasses cast accordingly & gave them to Chaloner & Chaloner to Hicks to get Peers to file them[23] & Gravener seeing them in the hands of Hicks said I know what those are for those are for the casting of blanks. And Hicks telling this to Chaloner, he replied, Ay, Let Gravener find out that if he can. And the brasses were filed by Peers & returned to Chaloner & Chaloner confessed[24] to the Warden of the M. that they were for casting of blanks & were thicker at one end then in other places to make room for the gate or gutter where the mettle was to run in & described the use of them to the Warden  but excused the matter by saying that they were cast three years ago & that he sent them to be filed only to see if Peers was so good an Artist as he was pretended to be. The way of using these brasses was also described to me by Tho. Holloway[25] so far as he had learnt it of Chaloner. And when Hanwell was newly taken up (viz. Sept 26) he described it to me exactly & said that Chaloner taught it him the winter before with intention that he should work at Holloways house & Chaloner find money, & spake of this way as the most profitable.[26] [27]Chaloner also  described to the Holloways or to one of them that  the stamps should be but little ones no broader then a shilling so that they might be hidden any where, & produced a brass ring of that size & shewed how with whiting to make a mold of it for casting of stamps & how to use that mould.

May it please  By the Wisdom & minificence of diverse of his present Majestys royall progenitors, there has been granted & confirm'd to the use and service of the Mint in the Tower; that parcell of ground situate on the left, at the entrance into the Tower: beginning about 30 Foott from the Warders Lodge & reaching to a gate sett up in the East part of the Tower at the end of the Irish Mint, near a building call'd Divell's Tower; conteining the ground lying & situate between the outward Well of the Tower, & the Wall of the Inner Tower: All which tract of ground was designd & intended for Work houses. Dwelling-houses, & other convenient Lodgings & Buildings for the OFficers, Clerks, Monyers Artificers & Labourers belonging to the Mint. But since the Restauration of King Ch. the 2d, a building has been erected, call'd Leg's-Mount, at the North-west corner of the Tower, faceing Tower-hill, within the Libertys of the Mint before describ'd, & barraques made therein for lodging souldiers. And another building adjoyning thereunto, erected in or about the year 169  for a dwelling-house for one of the Clerks of the Ordnance, within the Limitts aforesaid. And on the North-side of the Tower within the Limitts aforesaid, diverse shedds were erected at or about the time of the 2d. Dutch War, in the Reign of King Ch. the 2d. being ever since used by the Smiths of the Ordnance for making double-headed short iron-work for Carriages, & other materialls for his Majestys office of Ordnance Memoriall  And on the East side of the Tower within the limitts aforesaid, houses have been built; 'tis the late great Coynage, were in the occupation of the officers of his Majestys works: And were claim'd by Sir Christopher Wren & others the 10th of Iune 1699, by virtue of a contract made, as is said, between the Master & Worker & them  at the beginning of the grand coynage. And a house lately standing on the Northside of the Tower within the limitts of the Mint aforesaid, & in the occupation of Thomas Sylvester Smith to the Mint, is now demolished, but order of the Officers of the Ordnance, as is said, to rebuild it for the use & service of the Ordnance And the Mint-streett is now become, & made a great thorough-face, by the Soldiers in Garrison, by strangers living in it, And by people, whome the Warders being to see the Mint, & shew them the tower: which ill practice very much exposes the gold & silver monys, that must be carryed from one Workhouse to another, to perfect the Coynage And besides all the aforesaid encroachments upon our bounds & invasion of the rights & limitts of the Mint: since King Ch. the 2d plac'd a garrison in the Tower (which was never practic'd, or remember'd to be done before his reign) the Lieutenants or Chief Goverours of the Tower have caus'd diverse Centinells to be posted within the Mint at diverse places, who together with the Labourers, Smiths, & other Artificers belonging to the Ordnance, in great numbers, at some times, resort to the Mint, to the great & apparent hazard of divulging the mystery of the Coynage; by insinuating themselves into the acquaintance of our monyers Labourers & Artificers; by taking patterns of the tools, utensills, & Engines used in the Coynage, by corrupting the persons employd in the workmanship of the Gold & silver coynes, & hereby exposing the reputation of them, which would be a matter of very dangerous consequence to the trade & credit of the Nation And this intrenchment upon Vs, has allready, as Wee have very good reason to suspect, given an Opportunity

[1]
To a Burglary & robbery committed, as is supposd, by a Centinell, who being posted on the line, on the back part of our assaymasters Office did about 6 years since take-out thence an Ingott of silver of value; and there being a quantity of Gold lying in the same room a day or two before, it might have provd a far greater Loss to the King. And Another robbery was attempted about two years since, but was prevented, as is thought, by an Alarme And during the great coynage, Wee have good cause to believe, that great quantitys of silver wrought & unwrought into monys were imbezilld: some having been since found in the Tower ditch, and good numbers of blanks in the Thames at Low water; to the great detriment both of Melter & Monyers. And Wee humbly presume further to represent, that the Mint is not only very unsafe by being expos'd to Soldiers & foreign Labourers: but the discouragements to both Officers & Clerks, Artificers & all other persons concernd in the Mint are become equally grievous, & in a manner insupportable. These Evills every day grow upon us, and the consequence will be, if not timely prevented, that no Officer or any other person concernd in the Mint, shall have any dwelling-house left him, tho' as expressly granted him in the King's Patents, & by diverse Antient Charges, as Words can make it. All the Clerks in the Mint had heretofore dwelling-houses assign'd them, that they might attend the service thereof: And by the Charters, or antient practice, no person was to be admitted as a Lodger must less and Inhabitant within the Mint without a Written License signd by the Warden & Principall officer of the Mint: but as matters are like to be, if the aforementioned encroachments be not forthwith remedyed, the Officers & others belonging to the Mint will be obligd to become Tenants in their own houses, and to take out a License for dwelling in the Mint from the Chief Governour of the Tower, of officer of the Ordnance Now the properest expedient to remedy these very great inconveniences, in all humility Wee presume to be as follows. That, by his Majestys direction, a new Charter be granted to the Mint, the bounds & Limitts between the Mint & the Ordnance be exactly adjusted, that All Labourers, Artificers & others that are foreigners, & are not in the service of the Mint, & all Lodgers and inhabitants, that are now in the Mint, but do not belong thereunto, be Oblig'd to withdraw forthwith; That strong gates be erected at each end of the Mint, & one upon the Wall near divells tower & another by the Sallyport, which may be shutt-up every night, & open'd by day, at such times as the Warden of the Mint shall direct. That the Officers, Clerks, Monyers & Artificers have such houses assign'd them, as their predecessors have enjoyd for many ages; or if now demolished, others in their stead. That those Clerks be oblig'd to live in those houses, for the better security of the Mint, & dispatch of business; And such Artificers also, whome it may be neither expedient nor safe to suffer to live abroad. That the Officers of the Ordnance & Chief Governour of the Tower for the time being, be strictly oblig'd by a clause in their patents nicely to observe such Regulations, & others that may be thought necessary, in all time to come.

VI in order to make a judgment upon the causes of the increase & descrease of the coynage but have not yet been able to compass my designe the records thereof before the year 1660 being taken out of the Mint. And therefore least I should detein his paper too long in my hands I have here set down such Observations upon it as at present occur to me from such accounts of the coyn as are commonly known or remain in the Mint I agree with him in the main of his Argument set down in sect 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, that too much paper credit in proportion to money is not safe & every nation where such credit is large & upon the increase & money upon the decrease, ought to take care before it be too late least it become bankrupt by the sinking of its credit at once when there remains not money enough to support it. For paper credit is a sort of riches & riches incline men to luxury & luxury promotes the expence of forreign far-fetcht commodities & by consequence the exportation of money to pay for them, & while paper credit does the business of money & brings money to the Merchant to be exported the money may go away insensibly & not be missed till it be too late. But in examining by such accounts of the Coynage as have been heretofore given in by command of the House of Commons or now remain in the Mint whether this credit has been of more advantage to England by increasing its trade or disadvantage by increasing its luxury, I do not find that it has hitherto done us any great  dammage. Out of those Accounts Mr P. (sect 14, 15, 16, 17) represents that 20 years before Notes had a currency vizt from 1640 to 1660 there was coyned in the Tower  per an in {clo} in silver money 400000li communibus annis, that from 1660 to 1680 there was not coyned above 200000li per an including the Harp & Cross money & the price of Dunkirk, & that from an. 1680 to an 1695 there was not coyned above 80000li per an including the money from the wreck & that since the year 1695 we have coyned very little forreign Bullion so that the coynage since the 
        curren <608v> cy of Notes, that is since 1660 hath been upon the decrease. Here he sets down only the coynage of silver whereas that of Gold ought also to be considered, & in the first twenty years he tells us that 400000li per an was coyned in silver alone wheras that summ was the whole coynage of both gold & silver together; & the main periods & causes of the increase & decrease of the coynage he considers not. For the coynage was very great in the reign of K. Charles the 1st, then very small untill the enacting of the coynage Duty, afterwards very great against untill the late war with France & by that war became very small (except the recoynage) for the last ten years. And these vicinities of the coynage shew that its increase & decrease has depended upon other causes then the growth of paper credit  The Gold & silver coyned between the death of K. Charles the first & the return of K. Charles the second  & afterwards recoyned was about a million, that is about 88000li per an, which makes in the first 813 years of that period about 733300li. Subduct this from the gold & silver monies coyned from the last of March 1638 to May 1657 which according to one of the Accounts mentioned by Mr P.  was 7733521li. 13s. 4d12, & there will remain about seven millions coyned from the last of March 1638 to the death of K. Charles the first, which was about six hundred & forty six thousand pounds per an. For in this Kings reign Gold & Silver flowed into our Mint from Spain for provisions which we supplied them with untill peace was concluded between Spain & Holland anno 1648. But afterwards the coynage abated & became but the 8th or 10th part of what it had been before: so that in the next 18 years from the death of K. Charles the 1st till the making of the Coynage Act there was coyned in both gold & silver (including the money for Dunkirk) but 1228917. 12. 4 recconing Guineas at 21s 6d, which coynage was but about sixty eight thousand pounds per an. But since the making of that Act the coynage has been  constantly great & upon the encrease untill the French war put a stop to it. For in the first nine years of that Act that is from Decemb. 31 1666 to Decemb 31 1675 it was after the rate of 250000li per ann & in the next nine years it was after the rate of 500000li per ann & in the next four years vizt to Decemb. 31 1688 it was after the rate of 680000li per an taking one year with another. Whence it follows First that the Coynage Act has been of vast advantage to the nation. Secondly that the coyn notwithstanding the clipping melting & exporting thereof & the disadvantageous trade with India France & the Northern Crowns, the rebuilding of London & the luxury of 
         <609r> the English did notably increase till the beginning of the late French war, & was more upon the encrease at the beginning of that war then at any other time since the raign of Charles the1st Thirdly that therefore Paper credit till the beginning of that was did the nation more service by promoting trade then disservice by promoting luxury. And by consequence the check put to the coynage in the beginning of that war must rather be ascribed to that war then to paper credit. For paper credit works gradually & slowly but that check was on a sudden The coynage of gold fell then in two years time from six hundred thousand to fifty thousand pounds per an & that of silver from one year from 96000li to 2000li. And this 2000li was not imported by the Merchant but bought by the Master & Worker. For silver began the{nc} to go out of the nation faster then the Merchant brought it in & still continues to do so by the ill effects which that war has had upon our trade. Mr Lowndes reccons that in the reigns of Q. Elizabeth K. Iames & K. Charles the 1st there were coyned 15110 millions of silver monies: whereof all the crowns & all the money smaller then sixpences are long since  gone & also all the half crowns of Q. Elizabeth. And no doubt many of the shillings & sixpences of Q. Elizabeth & half crowns shillings & sixpences of K. Iames & K. Charles 1st were also lost before the recoynage of the hammered money. This loss Mr Lowndes computes at above ten millions but by subducting the 935 millions which remained at the recoynage it appears to be but about 525 millions. It happened by the wearing away & losing of all the small money, by Seaman Merchants & Travellers carrying pocket money along with them in their voyages & leaving it abroad, but melting down the largest & weightiest pieces for goldsmiths uses or to be recoyned or of later years to be exported by the East-India company, by burying summs of money or accidntally losing many pieces &  lately by exporting some of it for defraying such charges as the French was occasioned. Let us suppose that of these 525 millions three fourth parts were lost before the war & one fourth part or about 113 million in the first seven years of the war, & this 113 million added to the 814 & 913 millions will make about 9712 millions of sterling silver in all the hammered monies genuine & counterfeit remaining in the nation in the year 1689 according to the intrinsic value thereof & about 1023 millions in the tale of all the genuine part of those hammered silver monies Vntill the end of the year 1689 silver bullion came to the Mint in good plenty & the whole coynage of milled silver money amount to
 <609v> 3690051li. 18s. 00d of which if we suppose about a fift part to have been then wasted partly by seamen merchants & travellers carrying pocket money beyond sea & partly by culling out the weightiest pieces for the use of Goldsmiths or to be recoyned or exported to India (for the milled money being weighty was much fitter for the  Cullers use then the old worn hammered money) there will remain about three millions which with the 9712 millions of hammered money makes about 1212 millions of silver money (good & bad) not in tale but according to the standard weight & intrinsic value thereof in or near the  end of the year 1689 when I reccon we had most silver money in the nation. But in the late recoynage there has been almost 6900000li of milled money made out of hammered money & plate & by the proportion of the old milled money to the new at present in payments (which proportion I have not much observed but lately found the old in a certain parcel an eighth part of the whole) if the old be recconed at seven or eight hundred thousand pounds & the wast of all the milled moeny by exportation since the year 1696 at as much or perhaps at a million, there will remain now in the nation about 634 millions. Deduct the 634 millions from the 1212 millions & the whole loss of silver monies since the year 1689 will remain about 534 millions But all this was not lost to the nation some part of it was turned into gold. The  Guineas coyned till Decem 31 1689 amounted to 6843056. 11. 9 recconing a Guinea at 21s 6d. If the weighty Guineas culled out & sent back to the Mint be recconned about 18 of the whole there will remain about six millions one eight part of which (or not much less) may be supposed at that time current abroad in Holland & other neighbouring parts of Europe. The remaining 514 millions added to the 1212 millions of silver monies makes the whole cash of England at the beginning of the late French war when we were richest to be 1734 millions in intrinsic value besides broad gold coyned before the death K. Charles the 1st, & some few Pistolls. From Decemb. 31 1689 to Decemb. 31 1699 there has been coyned in Gold 2059384. 06. 07. If an eighth part thereof be subducted as weighty guineas culled out & sent back to the Mint & to the remainder be added the French & Spanish Pistols &  Guineas  which came hither from abroad {w}hen Guineas were at 30s a piece & afterwards at 22s  & all which (considering that above a million has been coyned here out of forreign Gold monies & that Pistolls are here at a higher value then Guineas)
         <610r> I'le reccon at about a million & an half, the whole increase of our Gold since Dec 31 1689 will be about 314 millions. And this added to the 514 millions in Guineas recconed before will make about 812 millions in Guineas & Pistols in England at present. Add this to the 634 millions of silver & it makes 1514 millions of Gold & Silver milled monies now in England. Which deducted from the 1734 millions which we had in 1689 leaves a loss of 212 millions of Gold & Silver together befallen us since that year. Had we lost ten millions since we {w}ere richest (as Mr P reccons) — 212 millions. So then instead of gaining 5 or 6  hundred thousand pounds per an as we did before the war, we have lost between 2 & 3 hundred thousand pounds per an during the war, & this by the decay of Trade, losses of our Merchants, charges of naval stores & other expenses abroad  & since the war by the two East-India Companies contending to replenish the nation with Indian Goods & break one another. But as for paper credit, that was so far from hurting us that the want of it during the recoinage brought us into the greatest difficulties. It was then found by experience that the want of it made the Interest of money very high which was very chargeable to the government in borrowing & put the greatest damp upon trade and at this credit recovered, interest fell & trade revived. And if interest be not yet low enough for the advantage of trade & the designe of setting the poor on work & encouragement of all such business as is profitable to the nation (as diver understanding men think it is not) the only proper way to lower it is more paper credit till by trading & business we can get more money. To lower it by Act of Parliament is a violent method, & force is apt to put trade & business out of humour. The law should rather follow & comply with the free & voluntary course of interest then attempt to force it. Let it be considered therefore what rate of Interest is best for the nation & let there be so much credit (& no more) as brings down money to that interest. For this is the due proportion of credit to make the nation flourish. We have recconed our losses in silver alone to be almost six millions which is much greater then that in both gold & silver together, the Gold encreasing while the silver was exported. And this certainly proceeded from some other cause then paper credit. In the 18 years before the enacting  of the Coynage Duty there was much more silver coyned then gold. In the first nine years of that Act there were coyned in gold monies 1154487li. 8s. 10d (recconing a Guinea at 1li. 1s. 6d) & in silver monies 1105103. 4. 4 which is very nearly an equality. In the next nine years there were coyned in Gold monies 3055473li. 5s. 8d & in silver 1647517li. 8s. 8d which is almost two of gold to one of silver. In the next five years there were coyned in gold monies 2414239li. 4s. 5d & in silver 578021li. 2s. 6d which is above four of gold to one of silver. And in these last 10 years there has been coyned little or no forreign silver, & above two millions of gold besides
        
     <610v> 
       
       the Guineas & Pistolls which came from abroad while much of our silver has been exported. If this descrease of the coynage of silver & running of our cash into Gold be recconed the effect of paper credit or of Luxury or the late French war, the cause of the distemper seems to be mistaken. Those causes might diminish our riches in general but not alter the propertion of gold to silver. This alteration proceeds rather from the cheapness of gold in China & Iapan, gold being there almost twice as cheap as with us so that our Merchants make a considerable advantage by purchasing Iapan gold of the Dutch & of late a greater ( {60} per cent or above) by purchasing China gold of the natives. And if this be the case there is no remedy A check upon paper credit will not help us. Our silver must go to China  till gold is dearer there or cheaper with us, And indeed its our interest to let it go thither. F China is inclined to take off our manufactures which India is not & therefore is fitter to be tended with, & the trade for their gold  must greatly increase our coyne, being as profitable to the nation as to the merchant himself provided we bring home the gold we purchase there (as we have now begun to do) & lay it not out in India. And tho this trade should diminish our silver yet if it leave us but silver enough for market money & workmens wages the gold will serve for all other uses. Paper credit is therefore  not to  be rejected as the cause of   of the decrease of our silver. Tis rather to be valued as a good remedy presentagainst our want of what we have lost or of what may be further usefull to use, & good Physitians reject not good remedies because they may kill but study how to apply them with safety & success. Credit being a sort of riches inclines a nation to an expensive luxury  & so far is of a poisonous nature but let this ill quality be chekt  by  good Orders & laws well executed & then it becomes a very safe & soveraign remedy. And to find out  &  propose such Orders   & laws is the perpetual buisiness of the Council of Trade of which Mr P is a most  able member &  I leave to to their wisdom. And to yours. I submit the recconings set down above to be corrected as you & Mr P. shall think  fit. I would propose therefore 1 that the two East India Companies be no more united nor the whole trade  any more given to one company but divided between them both, the old Company to trade to all paces from the cape of good Hope to India as far as Pegu or Malacca the new to China & all places beyond Pegu. For this will put an end to the  contention between the two Companies  & make them both more governable then a singple Company can be.  A single Company might be sufficient while the trade was in its infancy  but now it is grown  so great it makes a single Company too potent for the government so that good laws against their interest ca scarce get through a Parliament.  Divide them  that you may govern them & then you may encourage or discourage the trade of which company you please, as you shall find it for the advantage of the Nation, for this will make them  consult the nations interest as well as their own to gain the favour 
         <611r> of the government.  Credit is a present remedy against poverty & like the best remedies in Phyick works strongly & has a poisnous quality. For it inclines the nation to an expensive luxury in forreign commodities. But good Physitians reject not strong remedies because they may kill but study how to apply them with safety & success. Let that  expense be corrected  by good Orders & laws well executed & then credit becomes a very safe & soveraign remedy.  To find out & propose such orders & laws is  the perpetuall business of the council of Trade of which Mr P. is a most able member & therefore I leave it to their wisdom. And to yours I submit the recconings set down above to be corrected as you & Mr P. shall think fit, I being in some things not sufficiently informed in matter of fact."

That the Seales provided for the late Queen were by Directions from Her Secretary for which he produced his Receipts and that those for the Dutch Secretary were by Warrants from his Majesty. For the Signet and press for Sir Robert Southwell Valued at 18£ he produced his Receipt. As to the following particulars viz One Signet and Stampe for the Dutch Secretary valued at 12£. 10s, a Seale for the Queen at 2£, a Steel press for the Broad Seale of Maryland of 10£ and a Signet for the Queens Secretary of 10£. Mr. Harris had no Warrants or Receipts to produce, but shewed us the Impression of all but the last, and also Voluntarily made Oath before Vs that all but the last were provided and delivered which Oath we have hereunto Annexed. As to the following Articles in his Bill Mr. Harris produced a Certificate under the hand of Mr Pople Secretary to the Lords Commissioners of the Council of Trade that the Seals set downe for the plantations were ordered by their Lordships and Accordingly delivered. For the articles of a Braad Seale for the Exchequer, for altering two Signets in Steel and for five lesser, also for a large Signet and a small one for the Lords Iustices, he produced Warrants from the Lords Iustices. For the Broad Seale of Ireland, he shewed a Warrant from the Lords of the Treasury. For a large Steel Seale for the Lord Ambassador Harbord He only produced the Impression on Wax and made Oath of the Delivery and alledges that Mr. Harbord being in haste to go on his Embassy he had not time to obtaine a Warrant. For two Seals in Steel for the Dutch Secretary he produced a Certificate from Mr Van Huls then acting in that post that they were accordingly delivered, For altering the Broad Seale and Signet for the Garter, He shewed his Majestys Warrant. For the Seal in Steel for the Exchequer notes he referes to the notes on which tis still used, For the nine stamps for his Majestys Book he produced a Certificate from Monsr Dallone, who has the Care of the Kings privat{e} Library. For the silver Seale for the Lord Chancellour porter valued at 2£, and for a Signet in Steel for the Dutch Secretary valued at 4£ Mr. Harris only made Oath th{at} they were delivered. Vpon the whole Mr. Harris produced either Warrants or Receipts for all the Seals set downe in his Bill except in the particulars above mentioned for which he produced the Impressions on Wax an made Oath of the Delivery except in the Article of a Signet for the Queens Secretary valued at 10£ for the delivery of which he could not make Oath. As for the Quantity of Ounces of Silver made use of for the Severa{l} Seals set down in his Bills we are not capable of making any judgment since the Seals cannot now be produced and therefore have annexed Mr. Harris's Oath to that particular. It appeared likewise that the reasons why there was occasions for so many Seals in so short a time were, because several of them were immediately provided upon their Majestys being declared King and Queen of England which were to be altered upon their Accession to the Crowne of Scotland and were all to be Changed upon the Queens death As to the prices set downe in the Bills for the said Seals we can make no Iudgment, for as much as there are no former Bills of the like Nature remaining now in the Mint but if formerly there were any they have been Carried away with Several other Books and papers belonging to the Mint and therefore We can only represent to Your Lordships upon this Head that Mr. Harris affirms he has set down no other prices then what were allways allowed Him in King Charles the 2d Reign.

Mr P. thinks this abatement too much by far and that the Counterfeit Money scarce Exceeded 100000li I reccon it this the five millions melted down in the Exchequer proved about 7dwt worse then standard. This worsness arose from false silver money of base allay and if in the pieces of base allay taken one with another one half of the metal was fine silver the base money must have been about the 15 part of the five Millions, that is about the third part of a Million. There was another sort of narrow Counterfeit money made of clippings and broad money without allay and this being of standard silver, past as Currently as if it had been Coyned in the Kings Mint & for that reason abounded most in the Coyn. I reccon it therefore at above 12 a million. The Brass money being most discernable was least in quantity. If it be recconed 112 per Cent of the whole, it will amount to 75000li so that all the Counterfeit money in these five Millions amounted to about 900000li And if all the Counterfeit money in the other five Millions recoyned was but one third part as much, the whole will amount to above 1200000li. 2dly I abated 500000li for the wearing of the money & 3dly 3 or 400000li for the clipping thereof and the abatements were proportionable to what I had observed in some parcells of broad hammered money which had been long hoarded in the Country most of it unclipt and the rest not so much clipt but that above thirty years ago it might be very possible in payments the clipping scarce appearing to the Eyes without weighing the pieces. The abatements in my Computation for the wearing culling washing and filing of the Milled Money scarce amount to 1 per Cent & so are not worth mentioning. 4thly out of the milled money which in 1676 he reccons at 3 Millions I abated above a Million. For Guineas began to be Coyned at 4412 to the pound weight in Apr 1 1663 and from that time to the end of December 1676 there was coyned in Silver by the Mint Accompts 1779277li. 19s. 6d whereof about 220000li was out of cross & Harp money out of that three Millions I should have abated therefore above 1200000li. 5thly out of the 3 Millions recconed to be Melted down out of the hammered Money after the years 1676 I make another great abatement. For the hammered Shillings had one with another lost about 5 grains apiece by wearing as I found by weighing some parcells of unclipt shillings. These were therefore grown too light to be so fit for the Cullers trade as the milled money Generally was and the sixpences were more worne in proportion to their weight & the smaller money still more. All the money of Queen Elizabeth and almost all that of King Iames I and half that of King Cha. I was in Shillings + sixpences & smaller money & so not fit for culling to that melting pot. The half Crowns were scarce a third part of al the hammered Money and therefore in the year 1676 scarce Exceeded 4 Millions Of these 4 Millions part were hoarded in the Country and since the year 1676 came not to the Cullers hands, 
         part were clipt Either before 1676 or afterwards 
    & part were culled for melting before the year 1676 & the rest  had  one with another lost 6 or 8 grains a piece by wearing so that scrace one in ten was so weight as the milled half crowns. But if we should allow one in five to have been so weighty  yet   they could scarce amount to half a million.  I do not see therefore but that the abatements which I made out of Mr Ps recconing of 16 millions were reasonable, so that instead of supposing that about the year 1676 we had 16 millions of silver monies I had rather reccon that we had not then above 10 or 11 millions, & that in the year 1689 when we were richest we had but about 1234 millions of those monies not in tale but in weight & fineness. In my recconing how much silver money we have remaining in the nation at present  I said that we have about a million of old milled money or not much less. Mr P. thinks that we have not half so much? His reasons are the great consumption there was of that coyn after 76 & the small appearance of it in the time of the recoynage or since. This is a general way of arguing without coming to a recconing & so is of less force then the recconing which I  went upon For  that we have a million or not much less, I gathered  by the proportion of the old milled money to the new in a parcell or two. For I found the old about an eight or  ninth part of the whole. And  since the writing of my former paper I examined the proportion again  in a parcel of 25℔ of silver monies brought to me from the Bank of England & I found in it 3℔. 1s. 6d of old milled money. If there has been recoined 6900000li & the old milled money mixd therewith be now about  an eight part of the whole then that old milled money at its first mixing with the new must have been about 985000li. Mr P. says that if we have so much old milled money it ought to be added to the computation of the 16 millions. I answer that in the computation of the 16 millions Mr P. recconed 3 millions of old milled money which was too much by above a million, & therefore ought not now to be 
    
     <619r> 
        
         encreased So then I see no reason to alter my recconing of 714 millions of silver moneys (milled & hammered) still in the nation unless it shall appear by some  way of recconing not yet discovered that above 1500000li  has been  melted down or exported since the recoynage. What  is said by Mr P. to diminish my account of  the  Guineas in the nation  has been considered above. In my former paper I made an abatement of 18th part of  the whole for the weighty guineas brought back to the Mint & if that abatement should be doubled it would not very much diminish my recconing  especially if the Guineas coyned the last 14 months & the forreign gold monies which of late by the overballance of trade  have plentifully flowed into England & still continued to do so, be added to it.  And after the  culling & recoyning of the weighty Guineas has been allowed for  it ought to be objected no more unless it cane be proved that the allowance is too little. If in the dead months of exportation Merchants have sometimes coyned their Bullion, 'twas surely not with intention to export the same in money contrary to law but with the money to buy new bullion when the time  for exportation approached. If any gold hath been  bought with the clippings of &c So then I see no reason to alter my recconing of 714 millions of silver monies (milled & hammered) still in the nation.  For I do not yet see any reason to believe that the monies melted down or exported since the recoynage amount to above 1500000li. What is said by Mr P. to diminish my accompt of the Guineas has been considered above where I shewed that there has been not only a large coynage but also a large increase of our stock. In my former paper I made an abatement of an eighth part of the whole for the weighty Guineas culled out & brought back to the Mint & if that abatement should be doubled it would not very much diminish my recconing, especially if the Guineas coyned the last 14 months & the forreign gold monies which of late by the overbalance of trade have plentifully flowed into England & still continue to do so, be added to it. And after culling & recoyning of the weighty Guineas has thus been allowed for it ought to be objected no more unless it can be proved that the allowance is too little. p. 5 If in the dead months of exportation Merchants have sometimes coyned ther Bullion 'twas surely not with intention to export the same in money contrary to law but with the money to buy new bullion when the time for exportation should approach & therefore such  coynage made addition to our stock. p. 5 If any gold hath been bought with the clippings of silver monies melted down into Ingots & exported: the gold is an addition to our stock of gold & the silver exported is allowed for in my former paper in the 512 millions wast of the silver monies. p. 5, 6. And the like is to be said of gold brought in by Forreigners to get by loans upon publick funds &c For since the year 1694 we have paid our forreign debts in any things but gold. And those debts which now remain unpaid are not to be considered in recconing the quantity of  monies now in the nation but must be accounted for in the course of Exchange & ballance of trade which at present is on our side. All which being considered I do not see but that the recconings set down in my former paper come near the truth, vizt that in the year 1689 when we were richest we had about 1234 millions in silver monies (not in tale but standard value) & about 514 millions in  Guineas & Pistoles, in all about 18 millions besides broad gold. And  at present we have about 714 millions in silver monies milled & hammered & about 812 millions in Guineas & Pistoles besides broad Gold. In all we have about 1534 which is about 214 millions less then in the year 1689. In making this estimate I do not pretend to be exact. Where I could meet with exact recconings I followed them & in 
        
         <620v> 
    
    the rest I used the best of my judgment."

On the Argument against Paper Credit taken from the course of the Coynage.  To shew that the Coynage has decreased since the rise & growth of paper credit Mr P. (sec. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) justifies his assertions that there were coyned in silver communibus annis about 400000li per annum from 1640 to 1660, 200000li from 1660 to 1680 & less then 80000li per annum from 1680 to 1695. These assertions I disputed not except that I affirmed the 400000li per annum to be not in silver alone but in gold & silver together. But I represented that from this decrease of the silver coynage nothing could be argued against paper credit, & that for these two reasons. First because Mr. P. considers not the whole coynage of both gold & silver together which make our wealth but that of silver alone. For the coynage of silver from 1640 to 1660 was greater then that of gold & now it is much less & this alteration of the proportion arises not from paper credit but from the growing exportation of silver to the Indies while our gold stays at home, our Merchants finding that silver is a better commodity in the Indies then gold. Secondly because the decrease of the coynage from 1640 to 1695 was not uniform, as it should seem by Mr P's representation, but had several periods of increasing & decreasing according to the vicissitudes of peace & warr abroad, all which ought to be distinguished & considered severally before any thing can be concluded from the course of the coynage. For if the coynage in the reign of King Cha. & King Iames II increased with paper credit when according to his recconing it should have decreased, if at other times the decrease of the coynage arose from other causes then paper credit, then we must ascribe the increase to paper credit & the decrease not to paper credit but to those other causes, & so the argument from the course of the coynage against paper credit will vanish. Now the course of the coynage answered to the vicissitudes of peace & war abroade after this manner. The silver coynage in the latter half of Queen Elizabeth's reign (after she had recoyned the base money of her Predecessor{s)} & in the first five years of King Iames I was one year with another 
        
         <612v> 
    
    about 70 or 80 thousand pounds per annum. Then upon a cessation of arms between the Spaniards & Dutch it fell suddenly to less then 40 thousand pounds per annum. Afterwards upon renewing the war & making a peace between England & Spain 1629 it grew greater then ever & continued so till the end of the warr 1648, the silver Coynage being about 440000li per annum & that of both gold & silver 600000li per annum or above. Then upon the conclusion of peace between Spain & Holland it fell again & became but the 8th or 10th part of what it was before & continued so for the next 18 years this coynage of both gold & silver together being scarce 70000li per annum till the enacting of the coynage Duty 16667 by which & the flourishing of trade in the peacefull reigns of Cha: II & Iames II & the quick dispatch of business by paper credit notwithstanding our disadvantageous trade with France it encreased till it became about 680000li per annum. And then by the late war with France & the consequent decay of paper credit & trade it decreased again exceedingly. This agreement between the encrease & decrease of the coynage & the state of the nation in respect of peace & war abroad shews that the Coynage has principally depended on that state. And if paper credit hath had any effect upon the coynage it hath promoted it because both increased together till 1690 & afterwards both decreased together by the late French warr. 
    And therefore Mr P. in his first paper set the argument in a wrong light when he represented that the coynage had decreased ever since the rise & growth of paper credit. For he there considers the Coynage  of gold & silver together before 1660 & the coynage of silver alone afterwards & lessens the latter in the reign of King Cha. II & King Iam. II by taking a medium between that which preceeded the late French warr & that which was in the warr; whereas if he had considered the whole coynage of both gold & silver till the present time, & distinguished between times of peace & warr, he would have found the argument from the Coynage

        because the life of their trade. But Mr P.  makes an Objection which lies against all the circulating credit in England, that it inclines to luxury & luxury occasions the exportation of our money.  For this Objection lies not only against credit upon Parliamentary funds but against credit upon land or any thing else but money in a Bank, be the deposit never so safe & the security never so good. But if this be a good objection, we must reject wine because it occasions drunkenness, & all the best things because by corruption they become the worst. Rather let us suppress drunkenness, & keep our wine. If all our Paper credit considered as a sort of riches were turned into gold, the gold would incline to luxury as the credit did before, & the luxury would export our silver. Must we therefore throw away the gold for fear we should want market money: Why should we not rather endeavour to grow richer by keeping our gold & only suppressing luxury? But tho paper credit be a sort of  riches we must not use it immoderately. Like vertue it has its extremes. Too much may hurt us as well as too little. So much is best for us as suffices to lower interest, make dispatch in business, set the people on work & inspire life & vigour into all the busy part of the nation too strongly to luxury. For it enriches us only amongst our selves & not in respect of forreign nations. But What proportion in respect of gold & silver is best for us is a determination which may  vary with circumstances of time & must be left to experience & the wisdome of the legislative power. Observations on Mr P's Reply.  1. On the Argument against Paper Credit taken from the course of the Coynage.  To shew that the Coynage has decreased since the rise and 
        growth of paper credit Mr P. (sect. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) justifies his assertions 
        that there were coyned in silver communibus annis about 
        400000li per annum from 1640 to 1660, 200000li from 1660 
        to 1680 & less then 80000li per annum from 1680 to 1695. These 
        assertions I disputed not except that I affirmed the 400000li per 
        annum to be not in silver alone but in gold & silver together. 
        But I represented that from this decrease of the silver coynage nothing could be argued against Paper credit, & that for 
        these two reasons. First because Mr. P. considers not the whole coynage of 
        both gold & silver together which make our wealth, but that 
        of silver alone. For the coynage of silver from 1640 to 1660 
        was greater then that of gold & now it is much less & this 
        alteration of the proportion arises not from paper credit but 
        from the growing exportation of silver to the Indies while our 
        gold stays at home, our Merchants finding that silver is a 
        better commodity in the Indies then gold. Secondly because the decrease of the coynage from 1640 to 
        1695 was not uniform, as it should seem by Mr P's representation but had several periods of increasing & decreasing according to the vicissitudes of peace & war abroad, all which ought 
        to be distinguished & considered severally before any thing can 
        be concluded from the course of the coynage. For if the coynage in the reign of King Cha. & King Iames II increased with paper 
        credit when according to his recconing it should have decreased, 
        if at other times the decrease of the coynage arose from other 
        causes then paper credit, then we must ascribe the increase to 
        paper credit & the decrease not to paper credit but to those 
        
         <614v> 
        
        other causes, & so the argument from the course of the coynage 
        against paper credit will vanish. Now the course of the coynage 
        answered to the vicissitudes of peace & warr abroad after this manner. The silver coynage in the latter half of Queen Elizabeth's 
        reign (after she had recoyned the base money of her Predecessors) 
        & in the first five years of King Iames I was one year with another 
        about 70 or 80 thousand pounds per annum. Then upon a cessation of arms 
        between the Spaniards & Dutch it fell suddenly to less then 40 thousand pounds 
        per annum. Afterwards upon renewing the warr & making a peace between 
        England & Spain it grew greater then ever & continued so till the 
        end of the warr 1648 the silver coynage being about 440000li
per annum & that of both gold & silver 600000li per annum or above. 
        Then upon the conclusion of peace between Spain & Holland it 
        fell again & became but the 8th or 10th part of what it was 
        before and continued so for the next 18 years the coynage 
        of both gold & silver together besides the money for Dunkirk being less then 60000li per annum till 
        the enacting of the Coynage Duty by which & the flourishing trade 
        in the peacefull reigns of Cha II & Iames II & the quick dispatch 
        of business by paper credit notwithstanding our disadvantageous 
        trade with France it encreased till it became about 680000li
per annum. And then by the late warr with France & the consequent decay of paper credit & trade it decreased again exceedingly. This agreement between the encrease & decrease of the 
        coynage and the state of the nation in respect of peace 
        and warr abroad shews that the coynage has principally 
        depended on that state. And if paper credit hath had any 
        effect upon the coynage it hath promoted it because both 
        increased together till 1690 and afterwards both decreased 
        together by the late French war. And therefore Mr P. in his first paper set the argument 
        in a wrong light when he represented that the coynage had 
        decreased ever since the rise & growth of paper credit. For 
        he there considers the coynage of gold & silver together before 
        the year 1660 & the coynage of silver alone afterwards, & lessens 
        the latter in the reign of King Cha. II & King Iam. II by taking a 
        medium between that which preceeded the late French warr & that 
        which was in the warr, whereas if he had considered the whole coynage

And  in another annexed paper we have  compared the values set upon gold in several nations so far as at present we have been able to get intelligence. By which account  it seems to us that gold is valued higher in England then in Holland & France by about  7d or 8d in a Guinea & that in Spain Italy & the north (so far as we can yet informe ourselves) it is valued much lower then in England after the rate as in France. Were the melting down of forreign monies & bullion for exportation prohibited in private shops, & licensed only in the Mint it would give us opportunity of knowing more exactly & more generally the intrinsic values of forreign cons of several nations & the prizes of gold in the markets abroad from time to time & how trade goes with respect to gold & silver &  it might also prevent the melting down of our money in private for exportation. Exchangers reccon 1lib sterling at a par with  44449 Dutch styvers which recconning is grownded on a supposition that a Patagon or Dutch Rixdoller which is  50 styvers equals in value  a Rixdollar of the Empire or Ecu of France or spanish Piastre which is worth 4s 6d of our money whereas a Patagon is worth but 4s 4d12. And tho we are told that a Patagon in this recconing is Bank paper money which is 3, 4 or 5 per cent better then  specie money, yet the putting a par between our specie money & their paper money seems improper & may make the exchange more liable to tricking then if the Par were put between specie money & specie moeny, as it ought to be. For  between specie money which is of a certian intrinsic value & paper money which is of no intrinsic value & of  an uncertain extrinsic value  there can be no par  assigned.   Gold in  the East Indies is at a much lower value then in Europe being in China & Iapan but about 9 or 10 times of more value then its weight of silver whereas here it is above 15 times the value. Which is the reason why the Merchants carry silver to the East Indies & China & leave the gold at home, & that of late years as the trade of India has increased there has been much less silver coyned in proportion to Gold then formerly. In the first twelve years after the  Act for encouragement of coynage there was coyned more silver then Gold vizt 1669826li 8s 3d in Gold & 1896338l. 10s. 8d in silver In the next ten years there was coyned  above three times more gold then silver vizt
 <74v> 
        
        4363776li. 4. 10 in gold & 1337730li. 5. 9 in silver. In the last 13 years there has bin coyned out of forreign Bullion about 15 times more gold  then silver monies. And this decrease of the coynage of silver in proportion to  that of gold & the  decrease also of silver money by melting it down for exportation while the gold stays with us tends to  raise the value of silver monies by its scarceness in proportion to the gold. Which is a further argument for lowering the price of Guineas.  For the more plentiful gold grows in respect of silver the  more apt its price will be to fall. Laws against exporting money   may upon some extraordinary occasions do some good but usually do more hurt. Such Laws cannot hinder money from getting abroad  where it is wanted to ballance trade:  on the contrary they hinder Bullion from flowing freely into the Market of England & from the Market into the Mint for increasing the coyn. For the more Gold & Silver flows  through the Market of England & the Mint the more will stick among us. The best way of preserving & encreasing the coyn is to take care of the ballance of trade & encourage the flowing of gold & silver through the Market & Mint of England. Trade is ballanced by promoting the exporting of our  own product & manufactur  & checking luxury in forreign commodities especially from countries which must be paid in money. The old East India company was obliged to export yearly English manufactures to the value of 100000li. Were the present company obliged to export English commodities not of a certain value yearly but of a certain value in proportion to the silver they export & care taken to make them do it: it would put them upon finding out new ways of vending our commodities  for answer the price of Indian goods.  The prohibiting the exportation of money & licensing that of forreign Bullion  raises the price of Bullion above that of money which is of very ill consequence. If would be much better on the contrary to prohibit the exportation of  Bullion & licence that of money. For this would set the price of money above that of bullion as it ought to be, & increase the coyn bringing much silver through the Mint & by the new coynd money running amongst us till exportation & be of honour to the nation by the passing of our money  into forreign countries. For our money being  better standarded & better coyned then pieces of eight would in  time be of more credit abroad then pieces of 8 & make us appear more rich & potent then we for at present And some of these effects would be had by licensing the Merchants to  export so much money only as they coyn out of forreign Bullion they paying for the coynage upon shipping it for exportation If any alteration were to be made in the standard we would propose to have the silver 11 ounces fine as the gold is & as both gold & silver are in France & Spain  & the pound weight be  cut into 61s 6d, that the value of the coyn may remain the same. For the silver would weare something better & in valuing our money in Forreign countries the old 2dwt is apt to be neglected And it may be considered whether it would not be of some advantage to us to coyn some pieces of the same value & name with Rix Dollers Ecus or Pistoles for the advantage of travellers who are sometimes abroad constrained to putt off our crowns at the same value with forreign crowns or Dollers  for want for  crowns or Dollers of the same value with those abroad Silver pence & two pences as so small as easily to be lost & {sewe} for little else then curiosities&  for children to play with & if they be in use they quickly weare away. It may be considered therefore whether it would not be better to coyn copper pence in their stead. And to make the  three pences groats & so six pences a little narrower & thicket that they may wear longer"

[1]Mr P, (sect 26) tells us that the allowing of paper to pass as money must have (& we have found by experience it has had) the same effect as the permission of two sorts of coyn one false &  worth little & the other time & valuable.  & a little after (sect 27) he adds that paper when it passes for money is as a false coyne. I answer that there are two sorts of paper credit, one good the others bad. The good is upon good security & may be compared to good money
        The
        
         bad is upon bad security or without any security at all security & may be compared to counterfeit money. The first I defend, the other Mr P. opposes. For   paper credit or to {speak} more 
        paper security if it be good is  of the same  value with good money. If security upon a Bond or Mortgage or Bill of Exchange or a Bank Bill &c be good, its as good as money. For otherwise no man would part with his money upon such security. Good security is a phrase  which signifies security of the same value with money.  So long as we believe it good so long we are content with it in lieu of our money & when we begin to suspect its goodness we  take in our money & return back the security. Tis mere opinion that sets a value upon money we value it because with it we can purchase all sorts of commodities  & the same opinion sets a like  value upon paper security.  We value it because with it we can purchase all sorts of commodities & money too. All the difference is that the value of gold & silver is set upon their internal substance or matter & therefore called intrinsic &  the value of paper  security upon the apparent form of the writing & therefore called extrinsic & that the value of the former is more universal then that of the latter. But if Gold & Silver be preferable to  circulating paper security for their more universal value & circulation then for the same reason good circulating security is preferable to Bonds & Mortgages which have no circulation. For by circulation  paper security is rendred more usefull. One sort of  paper credit are Bills of exchange. These are so necessary to Trade that without them Trade could not be carried on, & their use consists in paying of debts without the trouble hazzard & tediousness of sending  money from  place to place. The like is done by Bank Bills Exchequer Bills & other sorts of good paper credit. And this makes such dispatch in business as enlarges Trade exceedingly, as is very plain by the great strop which the  the sinking of paper credit  this winter  put to business & trade.
         
 <631v> 
 [3] Mr P. allows that paper credit may be used sometimes as a cordial in cases of necessity but not as constant food &  reccons the  first Exchequer Bills issued out in the late warr to be of this kind & that it may be convenient upon pressing occasions to make us of the same method thereafter provided such Bills be issued out upon some fund & not for more then the tax may yield & be paid off when the money comes in. For, saith he, the danger of using paper as money does not arise from the immediate use of the paper but from the misapplication of that deposit &  for that reason he advises that as such paper cannot be  finally discharged but by payment of  coyn so care should be taken to preserve coyn in the nation for that purpose. He saith also that as such a way of giving a supply to the  publick may be convenient in cases of necessity so it may be necessary to have a Bank in the City for the keeping of money & the ease of making payment by assignment, but in no case to allow of Notes & Bills to pass as money unless a deposit be secured.  By all this he allows paper credit wherever the security is good, &   so far I agree with him.
        I agree with him also 
        that where
        
        the deposition is in danger of being withdrawn the security is  bad & the paper credit unsafe
            & such paper credit (not good circulating security) I would compare to counterfeit
         < insertion from f 632r > money & say that it may be  sometimes used as a cordial ins cases of necessity (like the brass money of King Iames in Ireland) but is not to be used as constant good.   This sort of  Paper credit Mr P. seems to understand when he compares it to counterfeit money & says that it is to be used only as a cordial.  For he speaks of credit where the deposit is in danger of being withdrawn. So then the dispute against Paper Credit in general is at an end & the Question which remains is only about the goodness of the security of the safety of the Deposit on which this or that sort of Paper credit is grounded. Credit upon a standing Bank if equal value is allowed to be good And Credit upon land security is as good And so is credit upon Parliamentary funds so long as the Government lasts & there is but money enough of our own to pay Taxes. Of this kind are Exchequer bills, Bank of England Bills, Mault Tickets, Million Lottery Tickets, Annuity Tickets &c But this security is weakened by the stocks of Forreigners in those funds. Five millions of money by circulating will pay a debt of 20 millions to our own people, but it will not pay a debt of six millions to Forreigners.  The credit of particular Merchants is more apt to fail then that of parliament  & yet must be tenderly dealt with because of the life of their trade But Mr P represents &c < text from f 631v resumes >  And so the Question which remains is only about  the goodness   of paper credit on that several sorts of security. Credit upon a standing Bank of equal value is allowed to be good. And Credit upon land security is as good. And so is credit upon Parliamentary funds so long as that Government lasts & there is but money enough to pay Taxes.

        that it promotes  bad trades most (that is such as export our money) only by promoting luxury in forreign commodities &  if that luxury be checkt (as it may be without destroying credit) the Objection ceases, & its better to check luxury then credit) which is the life of trade; & that  paper credit & the coynage Act in the two last reigns notwithstanding this luxury  brought in much more gold & silver to the Mint by trade then ever was brought in by trade alone before
        & that  as the strongest poisons  duly prepared & applied become the best medicines so those trades which we no complain of for exporting our money, if we can but check our own luxury in forreign commodities, may  become the most beneficial to us of any others by furnishing our neighbours with those commodities to drain away their money; but if we part with paper credit to check those hurtful trades, we check all  trade in general & leave the hurtfull trades to our neighbours who  will make us pay dearer for those forreign commodities then our own merchants do, so that we

        shall never be able to grow rich hereafter. I recommended credit for lowering Interest, because low interest is to the advantage of trade & business: Mr P. replies that the argument may be as good for limiting the rates of letting land because the cheapness of provisions may as much encourage trade as the cheapness of provisions. I answer that if provisions be cheap & other commodities dear the landed man will soon be beggared. Care must be taken of our land & native product as well as of our trade & paper credit is good for both. By lowering interest it raises the price of land & furnishes all the busy part of the nation (thus ba{illeg}dmen Grasiers {Artificers} Shopkeepers, Merchants) with money at easy rates to carry on their several imployments & is good for every body but the idle Vsurer & them that cannot live but upon the interest of their money. It may prejudice Orphans who are to live upon the interest of their  portions, but its good for the  nation in general & may enable father to provide better for their children & the publick is most to be regarded.

The arguments against it must not be considered alone but compared with the arguments for it & judgment given on the weightier side. p. 10  l. 20 to p. 12 l 23 against the circulation of credit. p 12 l 23 — p 16 l. 2 against more credit. p 16 l 2 — p 17 l 27 What credit allowable & how long  p 17 l 27      p 19 l 9 Care to {be} taken against exporting our coyn.

             & the Lewid'ors & Spanish Pistoles which are now recconed at a million & an half & the whole gold coyn will be above 8800000li   in the nation besides  broad gold & if  I say but 812 millions as I did {in} my former paper there will remain a wast of above 300000li to answer small objections. [4] If any gold hath been bought with the clippings of silver monies melted down into Ingotts & exported,  'tis allowed for in my former paper 512 millions  wast of the silver monies [5]And  the like is to be said of gold brought in by Forreigners to get by loans upon publick funds &c. For since the year 1694 we have paid our  forreign debts in any thing but gold. And such debts which now remain unpaid,  are not to be  considered in recconing the  quantity of monies now in the nation, but must be  accounted for in the ballance of trade which at present is on our side. All which being considered I do not see but that the recconings I set down in my former paper come neare the truth vizt that in the year 1689 when we were richest  we had {ab}out 1234 millions in silver monies (not in tale but standard value) & about 514 millions in Guineas & Pistoles, in all 18 millions besides  broad gold. And in  the year 1700 we had about 714 millions in silver monies milled & hammered & about 812 million  in Guineas & Pistoles besides broad Gold & the Guineas coyned 1700, In all we had about 1534 millions which is about 214 millions less then before. In making this estimate I do not pretend to be exact.  Where I could meet with exact recconings I found them & in the rest I used the best of my judgment.
         All which is as much as to say that paper may be lower interest but is not a natural way of doing it because it tends to enlarge  bad trades which export our money & when the money is gone the want of it will advance the rates of Interest."

But in valuing  monies in the Markets of one & the same nation (which is the present case) the money of that nation  having there a currency by it stamp is not to be considered as bullion but valued at what it was coyned for altho by wearing it be grown lighter then standard.

Pistoles therefore in the markets of England are to be considered as bullion & valued by comparing them with English money of due weight & allay without making any allowance or abatement for the lightness of our coin by wearing. In our last memorial we valued Pistoles one with another at 17. 1d or thereabouts.

May it please your Lordships In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to us by Mr Lowndes we have considered the Memorial of the Chancellour of Ireland about  erecting a Mint in that kingdom  & the other Papers accompanying it, & finding upon enquiry into the state of the coyn of Ireland that the forreign coyns which make a great part of their silver monies are generally in great pieces which are inconvenient for change in marketings & other small expences & that by the want of smaller silver monies the coyning of greate quantities of Copper monies for change hath been so much encouraged as to be complained of: we are humbly of opinion that this inconvenience may deserve to be remedied by recoyning the said forreign monies or some part thereof into smaller monies of the same weight allay species & impression with the monies of England, adding only such a mark of distinction as his Majesty shall think fit. And we believe it cheapest & best for Ireland & safest for England to have this coynage dispatcht at once by erecting a Mint in Ireland for some short time (as eighteen months or two years) under the same laws & rules with this in the Tower but with less salaries & fewer Officers & by lowering the value of the forreign monies to bring them into this Mint  we are ready to promote such a designe & particularly to supply that Mint with standard weights, Tryal pieces, Dyes & Coyning Tools & to try their money. The reasons by which the former Officers of the Mint in some of the Papers referred to our consideration, opposed the coyning by different standards are so much of force against a difference in the Denomination or extrinsick value of the same pieces of money & in the proportion of Gold to silver, that we are of opinion (with most humble submission) that the agreeing of Ireland with England therein may deserve the consideration of the Government as a Preliminary to a Mint whenever they shall provide for the charge of erecting one. The Directions in the Warrant of 14 Car. II referred to our consideration being applied & restrained to the present way of coyning by the Mill & Press without a Seigniorage & without fine & ransome upon two penny weight remedy in the single pieces we approve of. If a standing Mint be desired for coyning from time to time the Bullion of Merchants & others we beleive it may put Ireland to a greater charge then to coyne  such Bullion in London & how  it may in time affect the trade or government of England we do not know. Such a Mint may have been often & much desired but has either not been granted or not suffered to continue. For  <215r> to use the words of our Predecessors in one of the Papers referred to our consideration, ""It hath been the policy & caution of Kings & Queens of England to stock their Realm of Ireland with moneys (both for quantity & quality) coyned in their Mint in the Tower of London whereof one part yet retains the name of the Irish Mint; and King Iames (of happy memory) by his Indenture of the Mint caused his monies stampt for Ireland to be charged with an Harp crowned for distinctions sake whose Reasons and Examples (as we submissively conceive) may well admit your Lordships first consideration{""} If the Government of Ireland shall think fit to discourage the exportation of English money from thence by setting a value something lower upon the forreign {so} {th}at when {M}erchants {o}r others have occasion to export Gold or Silver they may chuse rather to export the forreign monies then the English, there will be but little occasion for a Mint in Ireland hereafter. A difference of one or two per cent in the value of the monies may be sufficient for this purpose & will mend their Exchange without hindring the importation of the monies of Spain or Flanders into Ireland by Trade.

About a month before the triall of the monies in the Pix his Majesty or his Council appoints the time & place for that Triall and names (if he pleases) the Lords of the Council before whom it shall be made & notice thereof is sent to the Lord High Chancellour & Lord High Treasurer of England & from the Treasury to the Officers of the Exchequer & Mint. The Lord Chancellour presently after this Order is to be waited on by the Officers of the Mint to send his Letter to the Wardens & Company of Goldsmiths to return him the names of an able Iury for that Triall and a paper is to be delivered to his Lordship containing the form of the triall. The return of the names being made to his Lordship he sends his Warrant by his Serjeant at Arms or Serjeants Deputy to summon the Iury by their names to meet at the place & time appointed for the triall. The Chancellour of the Exchequer is also to be attended about a dinner for the Iury. The place has usually been at the Dogg Tavern in the Palace yard. The Lord High Treasurer or Chancellour of the Exchequer sends an order for the Standard Troy weights & the Indented Tryall peices of his Majestys crown gold Monies & standard silver monies kept in the Treasury of the Exchequer to be delivered upon the day of the Triall for the use of the Iury In the mean time the King's, Warden's, Master's & Comptrollers Clerks severally extract out of all their books the weight & tale of all the monies taken up from time to time since the Triall of the last Pix & the tale of all the monies in the present Pix & when their extracts are all compared & agreed 40 or 50 Copies thereof are written fair to be distributed to the Lords & Iury at the Triall On the day of the Triall the Officers of the Mint cause the Pixes to be  brought before nine in the morning & placed on a Table where the Lords are to sit. About tenn the King if he pleases & Lord Chancellour & other Lords of the Council take their places at the Table aforesaid, the Officers of the Mint Exchequer Officers & Goldsmiths attending: and the Pixes  <228v> are opened by the Officers of the Mint either before the Lords sit down (if they direct it) or after they are sat. The Lord Chancellour calls to his Serjeant at Arms for his Warrant for summoning the Iury & appoints the same to be delivered to the Remembrancer's Deputy who attends there with the copy of their Oath. The gold & silver monies in the Pixes being poured on the Table the Lord Chancellour causeth the said Oath to be administred to the Iury. The Standard Troy weights & the Indented Tryall pieces of his Majestys Crown Gold & standard silver monies kept in the Treasury of the Exchequer being delivered for the use of the Iury, the Lord Chancello{ur} gives the Iury in charge to make triall of the said Gold & Silver money by the said standards of his Majestys Treasury according to the rules set down in the Indenture of the Mint & to do it justly with all possible care & exactness it being a business of a very publick concern. In the absence of the Lord Chancellour the Chancellour of the Exchequer administers the Oath & gives the charge The Charge being given the Lord Chancellour appoints the Iury when & where to attend his Lordship with their Verdict & then departs  with the rest of the Lords unless any of them be appointed to see the  Assays.

The Officers of the Mint examin the Indented Triall pieces of the Exchequer by the like triall pieces of the Mint in the Ward{ens} custody & the Iury doth the same by the Triall pieces of the Company of Goldsmiths. They also inform themselves about the triall & for that end inspect the Indenture of the Mint delivered to them by the Master & Worker & so proceed to the triall.

The Pix being opened the Jury tells & weighs all the money therein (Gold & Silver apart) & reccon how much it makes in the pound weight. And when they have told out of every species of Gold or Silver monies so much as should make a pound or a pound & an half or two pound weight they weigh it & melt it into an Ingot & weigh the Ingot & the grains & if the wast exceed not 8 or 10 grains in the pound weight they assay it, but if the wast be too great they tell out other money & melt that into an Ingot & assay it, & the Assaymaster reports the Assay in the same manner as is done in the Mint.

There are in the business of the Mint three trialls of Gold & Silver directed by the Indenture of the Mint to be made each of them  in presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller by sworn Artificers  & being made in their presence they are all conclusive and binding against the Master, otherwise not The first of these trialls is of Bullion upon any disagreement between the Master and Importer about the price. in such cases the Kings  Assaymaster tries the Bullion in the presence of the Warden Master and Comptroller and the Master is then bound to receive it according to such  assay altho his own Assaymaster should tell him it is to his loss. The other two trialls are of two pieces taken out of every Iourney of new coyned monies, the one triall of one piece before deliverance of the monies, the other triall of the other piece reserved in a Pix  till the time of the triall. These two Trialls are in all respects alike excepting that the one  is made in the Mint by the Kings Assaymaster and weigher and Teller sworn  at their Admission to their Office the other out of the Mint by a  number of Assaymasters Weighers & Tellers Chosen out of the Company of Goldsmiths and sworn before the Lords of the Councill upon  every new Occasion. for which reason the triall is removed from the  Mint to the place where the Council sits Both these trialls (as well  that without as that within the Mint) are to be made before the  Warden Master and Comptroller and if the monies prove uncovinable the Master is punished in them both, in the first by Recoyning  them at his own charge in the latter by making satisfaction to the  King so that the Officers of the Mint have the same station in both  trialls tho the last trial be much more solemn then the other. The last Triall is made not at the suite of the King in any of  his usual Courts of Iustice but by vertue of and according to a  Contract between the King and the Master set down in the said Indenture and therefore  like all the rest of the Indenture is to be looked upon as a part of the  business of the Mint. In this contract the Master Consents on his part that  the Pix shall be opened & Assays be made before his Majesty or such of  his Councill as his Majesty shall appoint & his Majesty consents on his part  that the Assays shall be made in presence of the Master and both  parties agree that the Assays shall b{e} made in presence of the Warden & Comptroller the King entrusting them against the Mast{er}
 <307v> 
        
        as well with the inspection of the triall by reason of their skill  as with the custody and Keys of the moneys untill the Triall be made What Artificers and how many shall make the Assays is  not said in the Indenture but the Custome has been (for the  solemnity and credit of the Triall{)}  not to make use of the  Artificers of the Mint but of others chosen out of the Goldsmiths  Company to the number of 24 and sworn in manner of a Iury  This is a Iury of enquiry not of Iudgment Their business is  not to hear witnesses & debate and Iudge but onely to survey the  Workmanship of the Coyn and try or Examine it by Experiment according to art in the presence of both parties and report the bare matter  of fact for makeing up an Accompt between them about the Coynage  unto that day. If upon triall the monies prove worse in weight  & fineness then standard and yet within the remedy the lack thereof is entered of record by the Warden and Comptroller  and thereupon the Master becomes proportiona{b}ly debter to the King  if better then standard the King remitts of the debt to the Master  if of just weight and Allay the recconing is eaven and at the foot  of this recconing the Master has his Acquittance and Quietus under the broad seal whereby he is  quit Excused and discharged to that day against his Majesty and people from further Examination of the matter or molestation about it   but if the money prove without the remedy he makes fine and ransome at the Kings will In this Triall therefore the King & the Master are the parties concerned who have referred themselves to this way of Tryall by consent and contract, so that the Master cannot be said to be  under prosecution. There is no accusation charge or action against  him no reflexion upon him before the triall be made Much less do the Warden and Comptroller appear at the Barr of a  Court of Iustice, neither are they present as idle and insignificant   spectators, but as the Kings Officers necessarily upon duty in their  severall stations in this Court under the Kings or Lords of the  Councill then present it being their business in behalf of his Majesty  and people to keep the Keys of the Pix till the day of the triall and then  to see that the triall be rightly made and to enter it of record  & make a true accompt thereof to the King that the same may  be fully answered to his Majesty. As for the Gentlemen of the Iury whatever be their  Character in other respects they are in this Triall the Kings sworn  Assaymasters Weighers and Tellers acting in the roome of the Kings ordinary sworn Assaymaster and Weigher and Teller of the Mint & accordingly are bound to act by the same rules set down in the  above mentioned Indenture Whereby it is plain that the Iury are  not to Exclude the said officers of the Mint from any part of the  Triall nor to propose to 
        
         <308r> 
        
        them at any time to withdraw but that  they continue together untill the veredict be given in, the Officers  of the Mint being considered under the  same Character as if the  whole business were transacked in their Office in the Mint For the business of this Iury being not a Iudgment made by  hearing witnesses and debating thereupon but a bare report of precise  matter of fact: tis not in the power of the Officers of the Mint to influence the Iury by their presence, unless in giveing them notice as they ought, where the Trialls are not duely made. If the Iury  be at liberty to repeat the Assays of weight and fineness till they  themselves are satisfied they can have no reason to Complain; and  if they are bound to do till the Officers of the Mint are also satisfied this makes the Tryall of greater force to Conclude both parties  & satisfy the whole nation then if it depended upon the Oaths and Skill of the Iury alone on a triall made in private.  such a  private Triall would not bind the Master because not made  according to his Contract with the King nor perhaps would it be advisable for the King to let the Mint by such private Trialls come  into the hands of the company of Goldsmiths and by being at their  mercy be secretly swayd and Governed by their interest. And therefore a Publick solemn Tryall is appointed by the Indenture which is  the sole ground of this Triall and rule by which they are sworn to  proceed in making it"

Mr Haynes has been in the Mint about fourteen years except two short intermissions & while he acted there had a general reputation amongst us for integrity sobriety good humour & readiness in business. He has a steady hand, writes very fairly, is a very good Accomptant & skilled in all the business of the Mint & in the Recoynage instructed the Officers & Clerks of the five Country Mints & did other great service. For these reasons the Officers of the Mint (Mr Neale, Mr Hall & my self) then recommended him earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury as a fi{t} person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the two late Comptrollers in that time of great business & when the Comptrollers insisted on Mr Berisford a stranger, Mr Haynes was appointed to take care of the Comptrollers business till Mr Berisford could qualify himself. Since the Recoynage Mr Haynes has been imployed in the Excise Office about two years by Mr Hall above mentioned who is able to give a further character of his abilities & behaviour in both offices. Yet Mr Neale in recompence of his services & of his examining & setling the accompts of the five Country Mints continued him his Clerk with a salary of 100li per an duely paid till his death December 99: which salary being now ceased Mr Haynes has nothing remaining in lieu of a setled business which as he represents was of more profit & which at the instance of some of the principal Officers of the Mint he quitted to serve the publick in the Recoynage in hopes of being further considered when there should be an opportunity, so that at present he is a loser of that service.  By reason of his abilities I have ever since wished for him back into the Mint, and if he 
     <122r> be not now brought back as he has been once already when we could not be without him he may be so engaged in other business that we cannot have him when we may want him.

These things I represent humbly conceiving it for the service of the Mint, to encourage & imploy those who by their past services appear best qualified to serve in it. All which is most humbly submitted &c  Is. Newton The principal business of the Weigher & Teller is to weigh the Ingots of Gold & Silver from the Importers into the Custody of the Warden Master & Comptroller who enter the weight in their books & by that weight deliver the Ingots to the Melter & after coynage thereof he weighs it from the Monier to the said three Officers & from them to the Importers by the same weight justly distributed according every mans share & proportion that there be no occasion of complaint to the discredit of the Mint & discouragement of Importers to whom I am answerable for their Bullion & whose satisfaction is my Interest.

It having been found of great Vse to Discourage Coiners, or bring them to punishment. But we are humbly of opinion that a Clause in the said Act, whereby tis made Felony for any person to take, receive, pay, or putt off any Counterfeit Milled Money, or any Milld Money unlawfully diminished & not cutt in pieces, at or for a lower rate than the Same by its Denomination doth import, or was Coined, or Counterfeited for, loses its Effect, by being too Severe Iurys being unwilling to punish a crime with Death which is often Committed without any ill Design. And the Law would be more Effectually Observed if the Penalty were less Severe. That there be a Clause in the said Act that the £40 Reward for Convicting any Coiner, shall not be paid any longer by the Sheriff of the County but by the Receiver General to be allowed him upon his Accounts in the Exchequer It being a General Complaint that the Sheriffs in the Country often Discountenance such Tryals, to avoid being out of Pocket so much Money. That from and after                  no person have in his Custody any Flasks for casting of Metals, without a License Signed by two or more of the Iustices of the Peace at the Quarter Sessions (which License shall be there Registered without Fee) under the penalty of                or     Months Imprisonment: the Trade of Counterfeiting being generally carryed on with those Instruments. And because the Instruments are made use of in lawfull callings, it is not punishable without further proof, when they are found upon suspicious persons. That for the more Effectual preventing the Currency of Counterfeit Money, the Bank of England and all Goldsmiths who Circulate Bills of Creditt be obliged by the said Act to cutt all Money they refuse in payment under the penalty of          for every offence And that for their greater Encouragement to do their Duty, the Receivers of Taxes be obliged upon Demand to change any Money that proves good upon cutting and that it be brought into His Majestys Mint to be new Coined All which is humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdom by I Stanley Is: Newton In Ellis"

May it please your Lordship  The Petition of Mr Charles Fryth for an allowance in his Accompts now depending, of 370li 8s 9d upon two Tickets of the Master & Worker of Chester Mint, with the Report of the Commissioners of Excise upon it, we received 30th March 1702 & in obedience to the Order of the then Lords Commissioners of the Treasury upon them we have enquired into the matter & humbly represent that we see no reason for that allowance. For Mr Fryth imported into Chester Mint several parcells of hammered money before Lady day 1697 for all which he received new monies before the end of Iuly following & endorsed the receipts on the backside of all the Master & Workers Tickets under his own hand which endorsements are ready to be produced, the last payment being of 345li. 16s. 3d in new monies due upon the last Ticket as Mr Halley Comptroller of that Mint is ready to attest. And after these Importations & Tickets thus discharged there were four others vizt The two last of which Tickets are those for which an allowance is petitioned, & in discharge of all four amounting to 1177li. 18s. 9d. Mr Fryth by a misrecconing hath received 1200li which is 22li. 1s. 3d too much. For the  first of these four Tickets No 149 became payable about the middle of August 1697 & Mr Fryth drew on the Officers of that Mint two Bills ready to be produced the one of Aug. 18 for 300li (the payment of which was entered at the foot of the Bill   in part of this Ticket No 149) & the other of Aug 19 for 100li. These Bills were paid by Williams (Mr Neale's Clerk) in the absence of Mr Lewis & entered by the Clerks of the Mint in their books in part of N{o} 149, and afterwards Mr Fryth received of Mr Lewis & concealing from him the two first payments made by Williams amounting to 400li,  deducted from the  two first of the said four Tickets amounting to 807li. 10s. the two last payments only amounting to 300li &  received from
    
     <476v> 
        
        Mr Lewis a Note for the remaining 507li. 10s, & delivering in the Tickets signed the discharge of them Octob 25 in the Master & Workers Book of Receipts ready to be produced. Whereas all the four payments amounting to 700li should have been deducted & the Note should have been only for 107li 10s the just remainder. And this misrecconing of 400li is the occasion of the controversy. Vpon this Note made erroneously for 507li. 10s Mr Fryth received 500li at three payments, vizt 150li per Bill of Octob. 26, 300li per Bill of Nov.  19 & 50li per Bill of Dec. 4: all which Bills drawn upon the Officers of the Mint by Mr Fryth are ready to be produced & the receipts are acknowledged by him. Had the Note been made only for 109li. 10s as it ought to have been this Note & the two last Tickets would have amounted only to 477li. 18s. 9d in discharge of which Mr Fryth hath received 500li which is too much by 22li. 1s. 3d After these seven payments amounting to 1200li the misrecconing was discovered & Mr Fryth demanding several times more money was as often told by the Officers of that Mint that he had already received more money by a misrecconing then was due to him & ought to refund 22li. 1s. 3d & cancel the Tickets. To which Mr Fryth has not yet given a satisfactory answer tho we have now written to him twice about it. This we take to be the true state of the matter, so far as we c{an} understand it without an opportunity of hearing both parties face to face & the same is confirmed by the annexed testimony of Mr Halley Comptroller of that Mint, & by Mr Fryth's Bills drawn upon the Officers of that Mint & the entry of the payments in the Books of that Mint ready to be produced. We are therefore humbly of opinion that the two Tickets upon which Mr Fryth petitions for an allowance are already paid off tho not cancelled & that he should make up his Accompts with the Queen without any credit allowed him upon them & that in his Accompts he be also charged with the 22li. 1s. 3d. For the Note being for money due upon the Tickets, whatever money Mr Fryth received upon this Not  ought to be set off upon the Tickets, & so much as he received upon this Note more then was due to him upon the Tickets her Majesty is defrauded of unless he account for it. For which reason if there were any private dealings between Mr Fryth & the Officers of that Mint by which he knowingly received any money whatsoever out of the Treasury of that Mint which was not due to him out of that Treasury for silver imported, we are humbly of opinion that he ought to refund it to her Majesty Or at least that in passing his Accompts with her Majesty all Accompts in dispute between

        him & the Master & Worker of that Mint  be set aside & left to the course of the law. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome"

        1s. 2d∟21. The Lewidor goes there for 14 livres which amount to 
        16s 6d∟94 english. At which rate a Guinea is worth 20s. 8d14. For as 
        17s. 2d∟8 (the value of an new coynd Lewid'or in England according to 
        the {illeg} Table) is to 16s. 6d∟94 (the value of the same in France) 
        so is 21s 6d the value of an unworn Guinea in England to 20s. 8d14 By the French King's Edict of Sept 17th 1701 the Mark of fine 
        gold is valued at 494 livres 6 sols 4 deniers & the Mark of fine 
        silver at 32 livres 16 sols 7 deniers. According to which proportion 
        a Guinea of just weight & fineness is worth 20s. 8d34 in English 
        silver money of just weight & fineness. The Ducat is coyned every where in Germany & some northern 
        countries adjoyning of the same weight & fineness excepting that the 
        Hungary Ducats are more certainly of full value. It is coyned for 
        two old Rix dollers of the Empire or nine shillings English, & usually goes 
        at that rate or within two or three styvers more or less, whereas in 
        England it is worth 9s. 6d∟3. But if the Rixdoller be of a lower 
        value, as are the Rixdollers of Holland Flanders Danemark & 
        several parts of Germany, the Ducat may go for two Rixdollers 
        & 6, 8 or 10 Styvers or above. In Holland the Guilder or Floren is worth 20d∟82 English & the 
        Styver is 1d∟041, as may be collected from the said Table. And there the Ducat goes usually for 5 Guilders & about 
        5 styvers, that is in our money for 9s. 1d∟3. At which rate a Guinea 
        is worth 20s. 6d34. In the Countries of the Electors of Brandenburg Saxony & 
        Hannover & Dukes of Zell Brunswick Lunenburg Wolfenbuttel 
        & some other places are coyned Guildens or Guilders of one & the 
        same value by consent of the Princes, tho of various allays. This 
        Guilder consists of 16 Gute Groshes or 24 Marien Groshes; and 46 
        Marien Groshes are accounted the value of an old Rixdoller or 
        4s 6d English. So that a Guilder is worth 2s. 4d14 or thereabouts
        By the Table it is worth 2s 4d17 according to the weight & assay. Now 
        a Ducat goes in the Countries abovementioned for 334 Guilders, that
        
         <104v> 
        
        is for 8s. 9d37 English & sometimes for two or three Groshes more.
        If it be valued at 9s, a Guinea at that rate will be worth 
        20s. 4d. In the same Countries a Lewid'or is valued at 7 Guilders 
        or thereabouts, that is at 16s. 5d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 
        20s. 5d34. At Hamborough the Ducat goes for two Dollars & about 
        8 or 9 sols lubs or sols of Lubec. This Doller is three Marks lubs 
        that is 48 sols lubs, recconing 16 sols to a mark. But the Cross 
        Doller (which is worth 4s. 4d∟91) goes for 52 sols lubs & therefore 
        the other Doller which goes but for 48 sols lubs is worth  4s. 0d∟84, 
        or thereabouts. The Marks & sols Lubs are there accounted double 
        to the Marks & sols Dans or of Danemark, & the four Mark piece 
        or crown of Danemark goes at Hamborough for two Marks lubs, 
        & by the assay of several pieces is worth 2s. 8d∟4. And at this rate 
        three Marks Lubs are worth 4s. 0d∟6. This is the value of the 
        common Hamborough Doller; & two Dollers & nine sols lubs (the 
        value of the Ducat) are 8s. 10d∟4. At which rate a Guinea 
        is worth 20s. 0d14. At Dantzick Gold is very scare. Their Guilder consists of 
        30 Gros, & the Bank Doller which is worth about 4s 6d goes for three Guilders 
        23 Gros. Whence the Guilder is 14d23. The Ducat is there 
        valued at about 7 Guilders 12 Gros, or two Bank Dollers wanting four Gros, that is at about 8s. 10d∟09. And at this rate a 
        Guinea is worth 19s. 11d12. At Geneva the Hungary Ducat was lately valued at 
        two Ecus & 2 or 3 sols of France, that is at 9s. 2d or 9s. 3d

        was lately higher in France then at present which might 
        raise the price of Lewid'ors at Geneva. For there the Spanish Pistole was valued only at 323 Ecus or 16s. 6d At Genoa the Croisat goes for 712 lires & is worth 
        6s 6d34, & therefore the Lire of Genoa is 10d12. And there 
        the Pistole is valued at 1712 lires that is 15s. 3d34. At Florence & Legorn, the silver Ducat goes for seven 
        lires & is worth 5s. 4d∟63 & therefore the Lire of those places 
        is 9d∟233. And there  the Pistole goes for 20 lires

And there the Hungary Ducat which goes for 16 lires will be worth 8s 8d∟32, & the Sequin of Venice which goes for 17 lires will be worth 9s. 2d∟84, & the Pistole of Venice which goes for 28 lires will be worth 15s. 2d∟56. By all which Gold seems to be lower in Italy then in Franc{e.} In Spain the Pistole (which before wearing is here worth 17s. 2d∟8) is recconed at gour pieces of eight of 18s. And in Portugal the Moeda, which is here worth 27s. 6d, is recconed at 10 Crusados or 28s. 7d∟1. At which rates the Guinea is worth 22s. 5d12 in Spain &  22s. 4d14 in Portugal.

        cannot yet procure that piece of money for an assay. At Florence three 
        Iulios are two lires & 1012 Iulios make the  Ducat & thence the Iulio

& the Spanish Pistole for 31 Iulios or 15s. 10d∟65 supposing the Iulio 6∟d15. At Bulloign & Ancona the Sequin of Venice goes for 18 Iulios or 
        9s. 2∟7d & the Hungary Ducat for 17 Iulios or 8s. 8∟55d. If the Ducat of Venice whose value is set down in the Table &c At Millain the Piece of Eight went lately for 5 lires 17sols & the 
        Philip or silver Dducat for 6 lires. So that the Philip is to the Piece of eight 
        (or 4s. 6d) as 40 to 39 & therefore is worth about 4s. 7513d.  This piece as 
        I am informed goes at Venice for  812 lires & therefore the Sequin 
        which goes at Venice for 17 lires is there worth 9s. 21013d, as before. At Naples the Ducat of Silver is worth 3s. 4∟43d, as before. By all which gold seems to be lower in Italy then in France the Spanish Pistole being every where worth less then 16s. At which rate the Guinea is worth less 
        then 20s In Spain the Pistole is recconed at four pieces of eight or 18s which is 9∟2d more 
        then in England. And in Portugal the Moeda is recconed at ten Crusados or 28s. 7d∟1 
        w{hich is 14d more} then in England. At which rates a Guinea is worth 22s. 512d in Spain & 22{s}. 5d in Portugal. In these recconings standard Gold is valued in England at 4li per ounce 
        as Goldsmiths value it for the melting Pot. The standard value is 3li. 19s 8{34d.}

        Lord High Treasurer of England.  May it please your Lordship  According to your Lordships direction we have examined the 
        values of several forreign coyns & endeavoured to inform ourselves of the 
        values of gold in proportion to silver in several nations & considered 
        the ways of preserving the coyn. And by the Accompts we have met 
        with Gold is higher in England then in France by about 9d or 10d in 
        the Guinea, then in Holland by 11d or 12d in the Guinea, then in Germany 
        & Italy by 12d in the Guinea or above. In Spain & Portugal Gold is 
        higher then in England by about 11d in the Guinea. For the great 
        quantity of silver coming from the West-Indies has brought down the 
        price of silver in all Europe in proportion to gold & principally in Spain 
        where the Bullion first arrives. The low price mends the market and 
        carries silver from Spain into all Europe & from all Europe to the East-Indies & China, the Merchant bidding more for it then it goes for 
        among the natives. In Spain the Merchants advance about six per cent 
        for silver & sometimes above, at which rate a Guinea is worth about 
        21s. 2d14 & sometimes less. In England they advance 3d or 4d per ounce, & 
        at the rate of 3d per ounce advance, a Guinea is worth but 20s. 6d16. Gold is therefore at too high a rate in England by about 
        10d or 12d in the Guinea. And this tending to the decrease of the silver 
        coyn, we humbly conceive that one way of preserving this coyn is to 
        lower the price of gold, suppose by taking 6d, 9d or 12d from the 
        price of the Guinea so as that gold may be of the same value in 
        England as in the neighbouring parts of Europe. France has set 
        us an Example for in the last war when the Lewid'or was 
        raised there to 14 livres the Ecu was raised only to 72 sols but it 
        is now raised to 76 sols though the Lewid'or be raised only to 14 livres 
        as before. So that Gold in respect of silver is lower in France 
        now then in the last war in the proportion of 76 to 72 that is 
        by above 13d12 in the Guinea. The licensing the exportation of Bullion whilst the exportation of money is prohibited seems to be another cause of the decrease of our silver coyn. For this makes silver worth more uncoyned then coyned & thereby stops the coynage & causes the melting down of the money in private for exportation. We are humbly of opinion that care should be taken rather to set the price of money above that of Bullion & to bring Bullion through the Mint, silver being
        
         <78v> 
    
    more apt to stay with us in the usefull form of money then in the useless form of Bullion, & encreasing the coyn whilst it stay with us in the form of money. For which reason it may be better to licence the exportation of money then that of Bullion, or at least to licence the exportation of so much money as shall be coyned out of forreign Bullion: which whenever it shall be thought fit may be convenient done after some such manner as is expressed in the scheme hereunto annexed.  The safety & encrease of the money depends principally on the ballance 
        of trade. If the ballance of trade be against us the money will be 
        melted down & exported to pay debts abroad & carry on trade in spight 
        of laws to the contrary: and if the ballance of trade be for us 
        such laws are needless & even hurtfull to trade. If trade can be 
        so ordered that no branch of it be detrimental to the nation the 
        money will be safe. For which end luxury in forreign commodities 
        should be checkt & the exportation of our own commodities promoted. If a law were made & well executed against trading with 
        more gold & silver by any Merchant or Company of Merchants 
        then in certain proportions to the value of the good exported, 
        such an addition to the Act of Navigation might put Merchants 
        upon searching out sufficient ways of vending our commodities abroad 
        & as we humbly conceive be more effectual for preserving the coyn 
        then the absolute prohibition of the exportation thereof.
     As for the alteration of the standard we are humbly of opinion 
        that if the value of the several species to be hereafter coyned be diminished without changing the denomination it will occasion the melting 
        down & recoyning the species already coyned, for the profit that may be 
        made thereby. And if the value be encreased the people will value their 
        Goods by the old money already coyned in which they are to be paid 
        and the new money of greater value (if any shall be coyned) will 
        be pickt out for exportation, & the Importer who coyns it will lose 
        the overvalue to the discouragement of the coynage, & in payments made 
        by tale to forreigners the nation will also lose the overvalue. But if it be proposed to retain the value of the several species 
        or quantity of fine silver therein & only to alter the Allay: we are 
        humbly of opinion that if small money which by continual use wears away fast & is apt to be lost, were coyned of coarse allay as is done 
        in several Countries abroad, provided it were well coyned to prevent 
        counterfeiting, such money would weare longer & be less apt to be lost 
        or melted down or exported. By small money we understand Groats, three pences, two pences & pence, unless the penny by reason of its 
        
         <79r> 
        
        smalness should be coyned of copper. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome "

The liberty of melting forreign monies into ingots in private shops & houses for exportation gives opportunity of melting down the money of Englan{d} for the same purpose. For restraining of which a law might be usefull against exporting any Ingots of silver melted down in England except in a publick Office to be appointed or erected for that purpose. The law by barring the exportation of forreign silver after it is coyned prevents the coynage thereof because the Merchant cannot afterwards export it, & tends to discourage the importation of silver into England because the Merchant can make no use of it whilst it stays here in the form of Bullion. The bringing of silver to the market of England & the turning it into money should rather be encouraged as the 
                    
                     <328v> 
                    
                    proper means of encreasing the coyn, silver being more apt to stay with us in the useful form of money then in the useless form of Bullion. If the merchant might export what he coyns, some part of what he coyns would be apt to be laid out here. And this liberty may be allowed him after some such manner as is described in the scheme hereunto annexed. The licensing the exportation of Bullion whilst the exportation of the money is prohibited makes silver worth more uncoyned then coyned & thereby not only stops the coynage but causes the melting down of the money in private for exportation. For remedying this mischief it may be perhaps better on the contrary to prohibit the exportation of Bullion & license that of money, & whenever the money is in danger to licence the exportation of so much money only as shall from time to time be coyned out of forreign Bullion. The safety & encrease of the coyn depends principally on the ballance of trade. If the ballance of trade be against us the money will be melted down & exported to pay debts abroad & carry on trade in spight of laws to the contrary, & if the ballance of trade be for us such laws are needless & even hurtfull to trade.

It is coyned for two old Rixdollers of the Empire or nine shillings English & usualy goes at that rate or within two or three styvers more or less, whereas in England it is worth 9s. 6∟3d. But if the Rixdoller be of a lower value, as are the Rixdollers of Holland, Flanders Danemark & some other places, the Ducat may go for two Rixdollers & 6, 8 or 10 Styvers or above. In Holland the Guilder or Floren is of equal value with 20∟82d english, & the styver is 1∟d041, as may be collected from the said Table. And there the Ducat goes usually for 5 Guilders & about 5 styvers, that is in our money for 9s. 1∟3d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 20s. 634d. In the Countries of the Electors of Brandenburg Saxony & Hannover & Dukes of Zell, Brunswick, Lunenburg, Wolfenbuttel & some other places are coyned Guilders of one & the same value by consent of the Princes, tho of various allays. This Guilder consists of 16 Gute Groshes or 24 Marien Groshes, & 46 Marien Groshes are accounted the value of an old Rixdoller or 4s. 6d English. So that a Guilder is worth 2s. 414d, or thereabouts. By the Table it is worth 2s 417d according to the weight & assay. Now a Ducat goes in the countries above mentioned for 334 Guilders or 8s. 937d, & sometimes for two or three Groshes more. If it be valued 
                    
                     <332v> 
                    
                    at 9s, a Guinea at that rate will be worth 20s. 4d. In the same countries a Lewidor is valued at 7 Guilders or thereabouts, that is at 16s. 5d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 20s. 534d. At Hamborough the Ducat goes for two Dollars & about 8 or 9 sols lubs or sols of Lubec. This Doller is three Marks lubs that is 48 sols lubs, recconing 16 sols to a Mark. But the Cross Doller, which is worth 4s. 4∟91d, goes for 52 sols lubs & therefore the other Doller which goes but for 48 sols lubs is worth only 4s. 0∟84d, or thereabouts. The Marks & sols Lubs are at Hamborough accounted double to the Marks & sols Dans or of Danemark, & the four Mark piece or Crown of Danemark goes at Hamborough for two Marks lubs & by the assays of several pieces is worth 2s. 8∟4d, as in the Table. And at this rate three Marks lubs are worth 4s. 0∟6d English. This is the value of the common Hamborough Doller, & two Dollers & nine sols lubs (the value of the Ducat) are 8s. 10∟4d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 20s. 014d. At Dantzick Gold is very scare. Their Guilder consists of 30 Grosh, & the Bank Doller which is worth about 4s 6d goes for three Guilders 23 Grosh. Whence the Guilder is 1423d. The Ducat is there valued at about 7 Guilders 12 Grosh, or two Bank Dollers wanting four Grosh, that is at about 8s. 10∟09d. And at this rate a Guinea is worth 19s. 1112d. At Geneva the Hungary Ducat was lately valued at two Ecus & 2 or 3 sols of France, that is at 9s. 2d or 9s 3d. At which rates a Guinea is worth about 20s. 912d. There also the Lewid'or was lately valued at 334 Ecus of France or 16s. 1012d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 21s. 012d. But Gold was lately higher in France then at present, which might raise the price of Lewid'ors at Geneva. For there the Spanish Pistole was valued only at 323 Ecus or 16s. 6d. 1 At Florence & Legorn the silver Ducat goes for 7 lires & by assay is worth 5s 4∟57d & therefore the lire of those places is 9∟224d. And there the Pistole of Italy goes for 20 lires or 15s. 412d, & the Lewid'or & Spanish Pistole for between 20 & 21 lires. + 2 At Genoa the Croisat goes for 712 lires & by assay is worth 6s 634d, & thererfore the Lire of Genoa is 1012d. And there the Pistole is valued at 1712 lires that is 15s. 334d. At Rome Florence Legorn Bullogne & Ancona (a city upon the Gulph of Venice) three Iulios make a Teston & the Teston by assay is worth 1s. 6∟21d & thence the Iulio is 6∟07d. Ten Iulios make the Escudi or Ecu of Rome but I cannot yet procure that piece of money for an assay. At Florence three Iulios are two lires & 1012 Iulios make the Ducat & thence the Iulio is 6∟15d. Now in those cities the Pistole of Italy goes for 30 Iulios or 15s. 412d, & the Spanish Pistole for 31 Iulios or 15s. 10∟65d supposing the Iulio 6∟15d. At Bollogne & Ancona the sequin of Venice goes for 18 Iulios or 9s. 2∟7d & the Hungary Ducat for 17 Iulios or 8s. 8∟55d. If the Ducat of Venice whose value is set down in the Table, be that Ducat, as I am told, which goes now at Venice for 6 lires 4 sols de Piccoli, the Lire of Venice will be 6∟52d. And there the Hungary Ducat which goes for 16 lires will be worth 8s. 8∟82d, & the Pistole of Venice which goes for 28 lires will be worth 15s. 2∟56d. At Millain the Piece of eight went lately for 5 lires 17 sols & the Philip or silver Dducat for 6 lires so that the Philip is to the Piece of eight (or 4s 6d) as 40 to 39 & therefore is worth about 4s. 7513d.  This piece, as I am informed, goes at Venice for 812 lires & therefor the sequin which goes at Venice for 17 lires is there worth 9s. 21013d, as before{.} At Naples the Ducat of silver is worth 3s. 4∟43d. And there the Pistole as I am informed goes for 45 Carlins or 412 Ducats that is for 15s. 2d. By all which gold seems to be lower in Italy then in France, the Spanish Pistole being every where worth less then 16s. At which rate the Guinea is worth less then 20s In Spain the Pistole is recconed at four pieces of eight or 18s, which is 9∟2d more then in England. And in Portugal the Moeda is recconed at ten Crusados or 28s. 7∟1d which is 14d more then in England{.} At which rates a Guinea is worth 22s. 512d in Spain & 22s. 5d in Portugal. In these recconings standard Gold is valued in England at 4li per ounce as Goldsmiths value it for the melting pot. The standard value is 3li 19s 834d. At which rate about 78ths of a penny are to be added to the value of the Guinea in forreign Countries.  I Stanley Is. Newton In Ellis Proportions of Gold to silver abroad."

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of Iuly 3 upon the annexed Petition of Mr Anthony Redhead late Master & Worker of the Mint at Norwich, we have considered the matter and humbly represent that the Petitioner for a debt of above 3300li due to the Treasury of that Mint had an Extent  taken out against his body & goods by Mr Neale about Michaelmas 1699 & was thereupon committed to Prison in Ludgate (as he represents) where he hath continued ever since. That we do not know what private engagements there were between Mr Neale & the Petitioner upon the setting up of that Mint nor how poor the Petitioner is.  But considering that he hath lain long in prison & that his estate if he hath any doth not appeare to us we beleive it  reasonable that he should be set at liberty so soon as it can be done by a due  method. For if her Majesty sets him at liberty she discharges Mr Neale & his security from the debt. The Petitioner was Mr Neale's Prisoner & to set him at liberty belongs to Mr Neales Administrators  & security & yet if they set him at liberty they discharge him of the debt. In order {to} his liberty we are humbly of opinion that the Accounts of the country Mints which lye in the Auditors hands be dispatcht with all convenient speed & that Mr Neales security do attend the passing of them And when it appears how recconings stand between her Majesty & them, we shall be ready to advise with the Queens Coun{se}l about the next step for bringing things to an issue All which is most humbly submitted &c"

        And accounted upon Oath to the Government for the Produce thereof. That upon calling in the Tin Farthings, & halfpence, (by reason of the 
        Complaints made against them) there was a Patent granted to the Proposer 
        & others, who contracted to change the Tin Farthings, & halfpence, and to

Which upon the late Happy Revolution (being at Portsmouth on Duty, & Mis-represented to his Majestie in his Absence) was taken from him, And he thereby left wholy Destitute of any Income or Provision to Support Himself & Family; deeply Involved in Debts on the Companies Account & forced to apply himself to a Trade (though otherwise Educated) for a present subsistance. That his Case being made known to his Majestie by the Duke of Grafton, He was sometime after made a Land Surveyor of the Custome-House; butt his Lamenesse encreasing through the constant Attendance on the Keys, & finding himself unable to perform the Duty required, He Exchanged the same (in Respect only to their Majesties Service) for a Kings Wayters-Place to be acted by Deputy, although a Place of scarce one third the Yearly Value. That although with this small Income & the Blessing of Gold on his Industry & Ingenuity, he has hitherto (with great Difficulties_ maintained himself, and Paid 300ll & upwards (having been often Arrested for the Same) on the Companies Account; Yet since no Prospect can be had in such an Employ, either of Raising a Provision for a Wife (whose Fortune was wholy Expended on the Command) or for Children, who in Case of his Death must be Reduced to the last Extremities; And since his 16 Years Experience (not without some Success too in the very Improvement) of the Mechanicks, and more Particularly in that part Relating to the Engraving of Seals Medalls &cta may have fitly Qualified him to succeed the late Captain Harris in the Employment of Engraver to her Majesty It is most Humbly Hoped he may have your Lordships Favour in the same Wherein if he should be thought Worthy, as he is very Desirous of being again Employed in the service of the Crown, He will not only very Faithfully Performe the Trust Reposed in him, but will also Contribute as much as in him lies towards the father Improvement of the Coinage of England.

All persons haveing a liberty to make Medals unless restrained by the Government the Gravers of the Mint have by a clause in their Patent been allowed and all others prohibited to make Medals with the Effigies of the King or Queen. And this Place of Medal maker to the Crown has been sometimes encouraged by a large salary out of the Civil List & sometimes granted to strangers and is no part of the constitution of the Mint For by the  standing constitution of the Mint the Moneyers coyn whatever the  Government wants whether Money Medals or Healing pieces, the metal weight allay & form of the money & medals being first appointed by the King or Queen by the advice of the Council, and the Graver only makes the Stamps. This I take to be the proper way of coyning such Medals as the Government approves of & I am humbly of opinion that no other Medals should be coyned by the Mint The Gravers privilege of makeing other Medals for their private advantage is an encouragement to them to improve themselves and to be content with less salaries. If it be continued they may be obliged to set their names or the first letters thereof on their own Medals to distinguish them from Medals made by the Mint or otherwise limited as your Lordship shall think fit, if abrogated they may want some other encouragement to improve themselves & may expect to be paid for the Dyes & Puncheons they make for Medals, Whether it shall be continued & in what manner or be abrogated is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdom  {Is.

Between Apr 6ty 1704 & Sept 12th 1705 there has been sold by the Pewterers {6}00 Tons, by the Officers of the Mint 488 Tons & by Mr Drummond about 1000 blocks or 144 Tonns, in all 1232 Tons which is after the rate of 860 Tons per an. From the 12000 Tons deduct the 488 Tons & the 144 Tons already sold & there will remain to be sold 11368 Tons. Deduct further 860 Tons per an for the 514 years to com{e} &  at the end of the term of the bargain there will be sold of 5148 Tons & remain in the Queens hands  6853 Tons. Which will 8 years more to sell it all supposing a cessation of digging Tin in Cornwall all that time & without such a cessation it may require a much longer time. The Queen pays annualy for Tin 112000 Salaries 3000 carriage by sea 2000 incident charges about 1200li in all 118200li  & in all the seven years 827400 besides interest. Her Majesty has receved for 632 Tons already sold 48032 & will receive further for 860 Tons 65360li annualy & in all the 514 years to come 343140.

The price of Tin in Cornwal has sometimes fallen to 50s & 58s & even 45s per  merchants weight: & the great glut of Tin when the time of the bargain expires may make it fall down to 45s per  in London or lower. The 6853 Tons of Tin at 45 per  will bring in 308385 which deducted from the said debt of 556000 leaves the Queen 257615 a loser by the bargain besides the interest of the debt  while the tin is selling off; which interest if the Tin be eight years selling off or above will  amount to  194787li or above so the Queen will lose at least 452402 by the bargain. By the like computation I find that if for the future Tin should be sould after the rate of 1000 Tons per an, there would remain in the Queens hands at the end of the term 6118 Tons & the Queen would be then in debt 380368 besides interest of money taken up to carry on the service which interest would amount to about 58320li & make the whole debt 438688.

Answered Wee have lost many Millions by this one objection in the sale of our Tinne but could neaver hear of the fixt places so that it must be from the world in the Moone for it hath ben allwaise comeing but Neaver comes. The Dutch are not afraid to advance their spice  for feare that wee should plant spice Trees in England & spoyle their Trade. Five burnes ad Vltimu Water overflowes ad ultimum Miners Digge & search for Tinne to the uttermost of their power and if they could possibly with all their witt mony & strength gett more they would. And all the Tinne in the world is yearly Consumed. And if it should be brought from the places where it is now Consumed in the Indies it would be wanted there. And as for finding of Tin in New places No one Man in ten thousand doth know Tin in the Oare the Tinners are forced to {Banne} it seaverall times a daye to prevent casting it a waye among the {Kelloes}, that is the other earth for the greatest part of it is soe mixt with other earth that the Tinner doe not know it. And as it is hard to be known so it is difficult to be founde & more difficult to be followed that it be not lost againe for the Vaynes often strike out & they loose them and they must be experienced Artists to fine it againe. there is also greate Art & skill in the Manadging of the Oar & dressing it when they have it they must first bring it to a fine sande like putty & it must passe through a greate many operations to come to that. before Smelting Wee are loath to you out of our old waye thats all that can be said. And the Notion of too Deare must be above 20l: the hundred {f}or I have  {and} that it will beare 20l: the hundred. Considerations relating to the Advancing the price of Tinne  1 Itt evidently appeares that as great Quantityes of Tinne are raised out of the Earth every year so there are great quantityes yearly consumed and the Consumption is as great as the production, for that in some thousands of years there is noe stock before hand, other than what is Occasiond by Impediments  stoppidge of Trade, by meanes off the warre so that what is in her Majesties handes is wanted in Germany & Hungary for Tinning of Lattin plates which are wanted all the world over. Were they supplyed in the Straights it would Make a great hole in her Majesties tinn or were the Tradesmen in Generall stockt as they will be if it be five pounds the Tun dearer in the Warehouse than att Landing they would have a half a years Tin before hand when they have not 20 dayes Tin amonge them all over this Citty or in Holland: or other places where her Majestie hath any Tinne. so that there is noe more Tinne before hand now than formerly only itts hinderd from goeing its rounde and what ever is too Much in one place is wanted in another. and there is noe feare of Tinne lyeing on her Majesties hands for as the trade hath required it and consumed it for thousands of yeares, so there is noe dainger of its noncontinnuance so to doe, for that there is noe more Raised than formerly. 2 Another Consideration for advancing the price of Tinne is that it must be had for all the uses by which it is Consumed if it were 20li: the hundred waight viz. a Copper Kettle of 60l: waight att 20d: the pounds come to 5l: & half a pounde of Tinne will Tinne it tho it shall not be 2 ounces the heavyer but the rest is wasted & this half pounds of Tinne cost 4d: but if Tin were advanced to 20l: the hundred the half pounde would cost 21d: & can it be supposed that if the Tinne did cost 21d: for Tinning a Kettle of 5l: price that there would be one Kettle the lesse Tinned in a year. There are hundreds of Tunns used & Consumed by Tinning of Copper yearly. The Tinne plates consume hundreds of Tunnes yearly and a farthing worth of Tinne will Tinne a plate &
    
     <581r> 
        
        if Tin were advanced to 20l: the hundred & this plate did take five farthings worth of Tinne they must be had & without Tinne they are of noe use. They cannot glaze earthen ware without Tin & if not Glazed tis nothing worth. The Masons cannot Pollish Marble without putty & Putty is Made of Tinne the Iewellers Glasse Grinders, Glasiers, Ioyners, Iapanners, and divers other Trades use Putty which must be had if Tinne be 20l: hundred 100 sortes of smale Iron are whitened with Tinne I will instance in sterrops or Bridle bitts which take not up half a farthing worth of Tinne canne it be thought if Tin were five times the price that there would be a pair of sterops the lesse made in a yeare in like Manner should you goe over all the perticulers by which Tin is Consumed as this all Consumed except a smale Matter in Pewter which is noe Consumption Neither is it other than the Dust in the Ballance in Comparison of what hath been Consumed. I saye if I goe over all & every perticuler by which I could ever fine Tin Consumed  there will be noe lesse made use of if Tinne were 20l: the hundred. How reasonable can it then be thought to bringe it to 5l: 5s  Another consideration is the People who pay this advance and they are 4 partes in 5 foraighners. by the Custome house bookes there is not Much above 1200 been a year exported but sea Men boyes & Passengers carry a little  of Tinne or half a dossen of Plates each that doth neaver come to the Cusstom house & many a Score blocks  are Runne in Cornwall if they are not belyed but it cannot be lesse than 4 partes in 5 exported & then the Nation getts 4d: for every penny they paye & the higher Tinne is advanced in Reason the More is gayned & that smale parte that is paide by the Nation is not felt for the Consumption doth not feell the price & if any one goine dearer for Pewter there is for but are furnished in England, only a master of a ship on a good Voyadge a sea Man on {Bredth} of his pay a Farmer after a good Market for his Castle will now & then geive their {weids} a New {Nach} of Pewter And at such a time they doe not feel it. besides Nothing is dear bought that cost noe more than it is worth. Another Consideration should be who are Gaynors 1 Her Majestie will gayne Freedom from trobule. 2 Her servants will gayn their Wages. 3 The Nation will save a base For it her Majesties mony doth not hould out the Parliament must raise more. 1 After 5 yeare Cornwall will gayn Considerably and Devon but it will be a very greate Advantage in Bringinge in Treasure to the Nation  Six Remarkes Incoraginge the Advance  1 That all Tinne in the world is in her Majesties handes or by Manadgment as safe. 2 All Tinne hath ben Consumed hitherto and will be Consumed if neaver to dearer. 3 Itt enrichest the Nation in Generall as above 4 Itt will as above Add to her Majesties Revenue. 5 Her Majestie hath absolute Power and Right to advance it 6 she is Necessitated to doe it or else she cannot Comply with her Farme &c.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships orders of Reference dated May 31st & Iuly 17th. 1706 upon the annexed proposals of Mr. Holt & Mr Williams to raise the price of Tin, We humbly take leave to acquaint your Lordship that the same Gentlemen made Proposals of the like nature last year for raising the price of Tin, which were referred to us by your Lordship. Vpon which we desired a meeting with some of the principal Merchants of the City trading to the East Indies, who were then of opinion that great quantity of Tin might be had in the East Indies, & if the price of her Majesties Tin were raised here, it would encourage the importation of Tin from thence, & thereby hinder the consumption of English Tin in Europe. Which opinion of the Merchants We then thought proper to report to your Lordship. Since your Lordships second reference of Mr. Holts proposal, he brought to us a Dutch Merchant, who informed us that he had been a long time at Siam, where the only East-India Tin Mines are, & assured us that those Mines could not yield more Tin good & bad together, one yeare with another, then fifty or sixty Tunns per annum; that the Indians had occasion for more Tin then their Mines supplied them with, that the price of Tin in the Indies was about sixty Gilders per , which is dearer then here, & therefore it was never imported by the Dutch but for want of other commodities for ballast, & that it was scarce used in Europe for any thing else then glazing earthen ware, being bought up chiefly by the workmen of Liege for that purpose. Vpon this information we thought it proper to enquire more fully into a matter of that consequence, & therefore delayed our report to your Lordship till we could be well informed of the character of the Dutch Merchant, & writ to Mr Drummond in Holland to enquire into the nature of the East India Tin, & what quantity their mines might produce. We therefore now humbly acquaint your Lordship, that we find  the Dutch Merchant has such a character both here & in Holland, that we think his credit no ways to be relied on, & that we have advice from Mr Drummond, that the best East India Tin is finer then the English, & will beat into a finer leaf without cracking & draw into threds, like silver & gold, & that the mines in India are larger then ours. & if we rise up the English Tin above 45 Gilders per  (which used formerly for many years to be under

                    38) the Dutch will soon supply not only themselves but also other places from India, they importing 80 Tunns the last year, & having imported formerly above 300 Tunns in one year, & that a high price will also encourage the Germans to work their mines faster. Which account of Mr Drummond agreeing so well with the opinion of the Merchants here which we formerly reported to your Lordship: we are humbly of opinion that the price of English Tin cannot be raised without diminishing the consumption, & hurting the trade All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordship great wisdome  I Stanley Is.

For if the Tin were at 3li 16s upon the wharf & at 4li in the store houses, the Pewterers would attend the wharf & buy there at 3li 16s when the ships come in & the Merchants who do not attend the Wharf would afterwards be obliged to   buy of the Pewterers at 4li. And further when the Pewterers have sold their stick, they would deferr buying till the next ships come in, which might be as much a disadvantage to the sale of the Tin as their buying beforehand would be an advantage. All which being considered we are humbly of opinion that if the price of the Tin be raised to 4li per  upon the Wharf it be also raised to 4li per  in the storehouses so that the advantage of raising it may go to her Majesty & not to the Pewterers But we do not think it advisable to raise the price at all.  For the sale of the Tin in the two first years of the present contract being very slow,  we had it  under consideration at that time whether  the slowness of the sale might not be in some measure recompenced  by raising the price. For it was represented to us with great confidence that it might be done without danger of stocking the  forreign markets with East Indian Tin by the Dutch, that Tin being  of a bad sort of  little in quantity so that the Dutch could not bring much more of it from India into Europe then they did already,   And this representation was backt with a better {intended} to be writ by a Dutch  Merchant,  who having been concerned in East Indian Tin was better able to give us an account of it then our own Merchants could do who trade not in that commodity. Vpon which we took time but upon making to enquire into the nature & quantity of East Indian Tin we found that some of it was very good & bright & fitter for some uses then our own Tin & that the Dutch might have it in as great a quantity as they pleased, & thereupon we came to a resolution that  it was not advisable to raise the price of her Majestys Tin, & we have since met with no reasons to change our opinion. In the beginning of the present contract for Tin the Merchants had stored the Markets abroad & the Pewterers had  provided a stock of their own with which they supplied the Merchants at home above a year & a quarter longer. And these things made her Majesties Tin sell very slowly during the two first years of the contract, so that at Christmas in the end of those two years there remained in the Tower          Tunns of Tin stannary weight. In the end of the third year there remained in the Tower          Tunns. In the end of the fourth year which was last Christmas, there remained          Tuns. And at present there  remains about          Tunns  whereof we expect that about        or          Tunns will be shop of for the Straits within a few days.  so that the consumption has been continually upon the improvement & the quantity remaining in the Tower has increased but little during the two last years.

By the Motto the Vnion is referred to the Queen as the minister of heaven in this work. And altho this Motto may at first seem flat, yet being compared with that on the gold coynes of K. Iames I, & with the Prophesy of Ezekiel to which it alludes, it will appear very significant, comprehensive, grave, lively, pious & majestick, & perhaps the most apposite of any that can be thought of. A poetical Motto is not so grave for such an occasion. Two women hand in hand imply only a federal union, or only such an union as is represented by the Motto on the money of K. Charles I, Florent concordia regna. England & Scotland, after the union should be remembered no more, & therefore in the Medal they should be only glanced at & not made too conspicuous. However for variety, I have caused two draughts of women to be made, together with two other draughts on the next pages; but prefer that above.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of the 19th instant upon Mr Drummond's Letter wherein he proposes that upon the receipt of 400 Tunns of Tin at Amsterdam or within 14 days after, he will there pay to your Lordships Order 4 pounds sterling per wt, which is 32000li sterling in all, at the rate of 10 Gilders 10 stivers per pound, rebating 4 per cent for paying ready money; the freight, duty in Holland & all other charges after it is once on board, to be fo{r} his account: We humbly represent to your Lordship that the Tin put on board {w}ill stand her Majesty in 4li per t, (vizt 3li 16s the price sold at here, 3s Custome & 1s petty charge for shipping it;) And that a rebate of two per cent seems to us a sufficient recompence for paying ready money. For since Mr Drummond has sold 400 Tunns of Tinn in ten months, as he represents in his Letter; if we should sell the like quantity in the Tower in that time for small parcels for  ready money to him or to other Merchants trading to Holland; the Tin being constantly selling would produce some of the money every day & half of it in half that time: which would be as advantageous to her Majesty as if we were to receive the price of the whole at once in the middle of that time. And therefore if the whole price be paid sooner her Majesty should allow interest only till the middle of that time, that is, from the time of payment till the end of the five months next ensuing the delivery of the Tin: which interest in Mr Drummond's case will   be  about  134 per cent supposing money at 5 per cent per annum. And so the rebate of four per cent  for ready money in his proposal is about 214 per center too much. And since he  gives us no  authority to insure the Tin on his account & proposes only to pay for it upon its arrival at Amsterdam, it implies that her Majesty is to run the risque at sea, which risque Merchants reccon at two per cent. So that her Majesty by this contract would loose 214 per cent interest & 2 per cent insurance, in all, 414 cent, which is above 3s. 4d per wtt; & in the whole price of 32000li amounts to 1360li sterling. And there may be a further, considerable loss, by paying the money in  Holland at 10 Gilders 10 stivers per pound sterling; the exchange at present being at  10 Gilders 15 or 16 stivers per pound sterling, as we hear from Merchants. And we further lay before your Lordship that the former contracts have hitherto discouraged all other Merchants from exporting Tin into Holland: who, as we are very credibly informed, are ready to export it thither in good quantities so soon as this branch of the Trade shall be  free from preference. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome. Mint Office 3d March

His Lordship is considering whether the Pix of that Mint may not be still tried before her Majesties Council in Scotland as formerly. And if so, We are humbly of opinion that  in conformity to the Act of Vnion there may be made seven indented Trial pieces of Crown gold & seven of standard silver; two of each metal to be kept in the two Treasuries to try the Pixes of the two Mints; two of each for the Wardens of the two Mints to try the moneys before delivery, & to decide questions between the Master & Importer about the fineness of the bullion; two of each for the Masters of the two Mints to make the moneys by, & one of each for the Wardens & Company of Goldsmiths to try their plate & manufactures of gold & silver. It will be also convenient that a Pile of standard Troy weights be made for the Treasury in Scotland by the Deputy Chamberlains of the Exchequer, if it be not already done. But if both Pixes be tried by the original standard weights at Westminster, six Trial pieces will be sufficient The Indenture of the Mint directs that two Piles of standard Troy weights be made by the Warden of the Mint & one of them delivered to the General of the Mint in Scotland. They may be printed like the weights sent to the Corporations & in the absence of the General delivered to your Lordships order. For setting the coynage speedily on foot in that Mint, her Majesty may please to issue out her Warrant to the General & other Officers with a copy of the Indenture of the Mint in the Tower annexed to it, authorising & requiring them to act under those Rules there set down which relate to their several Offices, & particularly that the Master coyn all the moneys of the weight & fineness & within the remedies there set down & take care that the several pieces be not lighter then their counterpoises, & that the Warden & Counter-warden survey & Cheque the proceedings of all the other Officers & Ministers & see that the moneys be well & duly coyned in all respects & that an account be kept of the Dyes & Puncheons. Another Warrant may be directed to the Master of that Mint authorising him to command the Graver to make Puncheons & Dyes for coyning the money of the same form with the money coyned in the Tower of London, & to use such master Puncheons as shall be sent him from the Tower untill the Puncheons made by him self shall be approved by the Officers of that Mint, & to set the letter E (the first letter of the name of the City of Edinborough) or such other mark as shall be appointed under her Majesties effigies, as in the specimens of Dyes which will be sent him from the Tower, that the money of the two Mints may thereby distinguished. An Instrument may be drawn up at any time hereafter, either in the form of an Indenture between her Majesty & the Master of that Mint, or in the form of a Warrant, prescribing the duty of every Officer in particular. In the late recoinage of the hammered moneys in England, one tenth part of the silver was coyned into sixpences & four tenths into shillings; & the same proportion may be prescribed in one of the Warrants above mentioned, if it be thought fit. The Gravers tell us that Puncheons & two pair of Dyes for shillings with the new arms, will be ready to be sent to Edinborough within a fortnight. And while they are coyning shillings in that Mint, there may be Puncheons made for coyning other money.

You see that though the first mold be Standard by the Assay masters report, yet the last is near 2dwt better. I must again beg your directions what to doe in this case; for this is a great uncertainty. I have also, as you directed me, sent you a piece of silver which our Assay Master finds to be precisely standard. This is that which is sealed. I must pray you to cause all those four pieces to be assayed in the Tower and give me an account of the tryal.

That after the 14 is poured off, the fire may be abated, and assay taken of what remaines in the pot; which being reported the fire is to be increased again, & allay put into the pott as shall be standarded by the Clerks, and an assay of the first & last mold of the second pouring taken; And the like, if the put be continued in the furnace and a third pouring made. But the experience of Novr 4, makes it more adviseable for the master to pour off only ten molds at a pouring, which therefore is ordered. 2° It being observed that scissell being melted down refines beyond the remedies: It was agreed that scissell should be melted down, & an assay of it taken & allayed accordingly: This method to be in force only untill orders about the melting be sent from London, or a melter come from London, who will soe temper our Coallfire, as to keep the silver in a halfe penny weight of fineness from the begining of the pouring of to the end of it. Concerning which there was a memoriall sent (by order of the officers) to the Master on Tuesday 28 October. 3° The very like, with the same qualification of time was ordered concerning the silver that remaines in the bottom of the pot, when the Ladle cannot be more dipped in it.

May it please your Lordship  It has been found by experience  in her Majestys Mint at Edinburg{h} that in melting the silver & lading it out into moulds, the allay fumes away while the silver is lading out so that when the silver first laded out is  standard, that which is last laded out proves  about three halfpenny weight  finer then standard.  And the scissel when remelted proves all of it finer then standard & some of it without the remedy. Whence it has been the practise of the said Mint to add a halfpenny weight of copper to  every pound weight of silver for supplying the wast of the allay made by its fuming away & to putt this  copper into the pot when the silver is half laded off that the silver which remains to be laded off may become of the same standard fineness with that which was laded off before. We use scotch or Pit coale  which causes a greater heat then the  coale  used in the Tower & {so} makes the copper fume away faster, & that coale not being to be had in Scotland & carriage by sea being uncertain &  there being at present no time to try experiments for regulating the fire nor any artificer in London who is experienced in melting with Scotch coale, I humbly pray  your Lordship that the  officers of her Majestys Mint at Edinburgh may be still allowed if her Majesty pleases to use their ancient method of reducing the molten silver to standard untill the present recoinage of the moneys in Scotland shall be finished, it being otherwise impracticable to  make the moneys of due standard fineness or to  coyn  with dispatch, & safety  All which &c. Allardes Master of her Majesty Mint at Edinburgh We are humbly of opinion that it  is reasonable & agreeable to the Indenture of the Mint & at present necessary for the Master of her Majestys Mint in Scotland to  allay the silver in such manner & proportion as shall be  most effectual & exact for making  the moneys of due standard fineness, provided the allay be put in not by conjecture of in an arbitrary manner but according to such rule or rules as shall be grounded upon experience  & agreed upon by the Officers of that Mint & allowed by her Majesty. And particualrly that he may be allowed to allay the silver in the middle of its ladling out  in such proportion as  ha{th} been usual untill the moneys in Scotland shall be recoyned, especially since by many experiment newly made in that Mint the silver is found to refine in the proportion alleged in the memorial & the moneys coyned by their ancient method provided better then standard in the late trial of the pix & there is no time at present for making experiments to bring this matter to an exacter regulation."

But its not practicable for any man  to undertake the meltings with your Pit Coal   untill he has had some experience working with  it, & finds out by that experience how the fire may be governed so as not to over heat the metal. For no man can undertake to do a thing before he knows how to do it, nor know how to do a thing of this nature without experience. * < insertion from the top > * All that we can do is to send you down a Melter who may assist you in moderating the fire as well as he can till he has learnt by experience to do it as well as he should. < text from f 201r resumes >  By your putting in the  allay when you are ready to pour off I know that your metall is much too hot for otherwise the allay would not be melted so quickly We put in the allay soon after the silver begins to run, that it may have time to melt, I heare also that the Barrs are sandy For if the metal be too hot it will disturbe the sand & make it blow. I Feare your Melter makes too much hast with the  melting & putts in too much fire to make the silver melt quickly, & that your potts are too thin & your furnace not so substantial as ours. For if the silver heat too fast it will grow too hot, & if the pot be too thin it will heat faster then if the Pot be thick, &  a thin furnace  heats sooner then a thick one &  may grow so hot on the outside  as to scorch the Melter when he lades off the pot Our Pots are about an inch & a quarter or an inch & an half thick &  we melt three times a day in the same furnace & no more & the silver (according to the best of my memory) is about 2 hours or 212 in melting the first time. But the  furnace being once heated the silver runs sooner the second & third time.  Pray therefore the next melting see that no more coals be put into the furnace then suffice to make the silver run in two hours time or 212, & see that the heat be not encreased suddenly to make the silver run, but kept eaven & let the allay be put  soon after the silver begins to run  that it may have time to melt & mix well with the silver, & as soon as the silver is all melted  & hot enough to run to the bottom of the mold  before it congeales let the melter lade it off with all dispatch. We lade off a pot of 5 or 600 weight in 20 or 24 minutes. If the furnace holds too many coals,   the Melter may put in some brick-bats or  stones instead of coales. And if the furnace grow too hot on the outside it may be cased  with bricks. The more substantial the Pot & Furnace is the eaven will the heat of the silver bee. Since the scissel is too fine to be remelted without allay, I doubt it must be  run into Ingots & the Ingots rated & standarded  & allayed a new but it may be kept a while till the meltings are setled. As soon as the melting is put into better order, which I hope will be in two or three meltings more, you may come away. For my Lord Treasurer has given me leave to dismiss you.  But before you come away, I desire that you would take a survey of the whole Mint & see particularly how many hours the Mill works in a day & whether there be room for another mill, & how many sizers are at work &  how many more there is room for, & what is further to be done that  they may coine 8 or 9000li weekly & I desire you would leave a correspondence between me & Mr Scott or Mr Drummond or both of them for promoting the service."

And Therfor if the pot Assay be a penny better or worse It ought to be remelted; And also if the money at delivery be a penny better or worse weight, it ought not to pass but be remelted on the Moneyers charges. This I must acknowledge did not appear so clear to my weak Capacity by the Indenture for I did think that if the melter gave out his bars within 2 pennys better or worse of the fineness, He might plead upon the Remedies that they could not be refusd And the Moneyers did affirm that their delivery is good if not above the 2 pennies better or worse in the weight and that they wer in use so to do. So that we wer in great doubt here how to determine the mater as to the remelting, If any of the Iournals upon Assay should hapen'd Not to be past by reason of the Moneys being beyond the Remedies in the Case above. But yet I think where the Remedies fall to be on One Side that is 2 penny better or worse in fineness, and the weight standart: (et per contra) The money might be past by the Indenture: Tho at the same I do acknowledge the Remedies ought not to be wrought upon. I have communicat your Letter to the Wardens and given a Copy to the Moneyers: The difference has never Yet hapend, And I hope now all concerned shall take more care it do not. Our Pots use Sometimes to be remelted for coming up too fine, And that being accidental I understand should be on the Queens charges, But I do not know how to state it. I proposed another Question to Allardes, I was obliged to take from the Moneyers amongst their Scissell Any Brokeage or spoilt peeces? By Brockage I mean the peeces spoilt at the Press In setting the Dyes, Or where the Impression is faulty and not good. And by Spoilt peeces I mean those that hapen to be too light drawn at the miln, and may be cut out, but go no further than the Cutter, or it may be spoilt in the Iusting or Seizing, and so thrown in amongst the Scissell. I have hitherto received of both, but a great quantity of the Latter And as I desire to do fair things and Iustice to all; So I would have the Like done to me, And would not willingly be imposed upon, Especially wher I bear Charge and trust for and represent another, which with an Insinuation I had of my not being obliged to it, made me propose the doubt. And wherin I must beg the favour to be also Solved. Our method here formerly was of the Light Crowns to make fourty penies, Of the fourty penies twenties & of the twentys tens &c Sir I had presumed to trouble you with my Severall difficulties befor this, had not my Principal been on the place; Your true friendship to him and Generous Character makes me the more bold to use this liberty and to expect You will forgive me. Since the Moneyers are obliged to do the money by the miln and Press  <170v> It occurs to me also as doubtfull whether they pay the Edging. Now as to the State of our Coinage That you may know a little of it; By our acts of Parliament (which we reckon here to be yet in force) The Master is allowed 20 pound Scots money upon the Coinage of the Scots stone weight of Silver. Twenty pound Scots money is £1: 13sh. 4d English money. The Scots Stone weight Consists of 16 Scots pound weight, And the pound weight of 16 Scots ounces, which you know: So that the allowance on the English pound weight or 12 ounces troy by our acts s{hould} be {1}9 pence 112 and a fraction, And in the 100 pound weight 7li. 19sh: 134 and a fraction. By our acts of Parliament also all tools and reparations & are to be allowed. And the allowance for the Stone weight Coinage is ordered to be advanced by the Thesaury As the Bullion is brought in, Other wise the Master at Liberty to stop the Coinage. We are in course to receive weekly from the Bank 9000 pounds Sterline Money Weighting about 4600 English pounds Troy: So that according to the acts of Parliament The Master ought to have Imprest to him weeky a sume proportionall to the allowance on the stone or pound weight for its coinage. We have already Received of foraign money 113000£ sterling weighting Standart about 31312 pound Troy: And we have Delivered {2}{4}1600 weight Ther is yet 19000 £ sterling of foraign Coin to come in from the Bank wherof is 16000 in Dollars which will be about 12 Worse on the Assay overhead And Consequently Occasion a great refineage, And for which I see no Remedy Since we cannot wait the Inbringing of the Money: And when the milnd money is brought in therafter (Tho reckoned Standart) Yet by the remeltings may hapen to come up Better And So put me in a difficulty after of providing Course money: All which are Considerations in my  humble Opinion for a good stock to be imprest to the Master for carieing on the work and making up his great waist And all he has gott yet imprest to him is {1}800 £ sterling Of which I cannot reckon under 500 £ for Tools reparations and other Necessaries provided here. I have already refined Gross weight 1713 pound being 1814 standard And have 150 more not yet assayed. I Suppose Likewayes the Master amongst his other charges is to be al::lowed the penny he payes the Moneyers over the Eight pence per pound weight 8 pence being their due by the Indenture, And the other penny payed at discretion of the officers But to be allowed by the Queen to the Master in his accompts. All this I humbly Submit to you, And beging again pardon for the trouble And that you'll also please excuse wherin I may not be so clear or distinct I am  Edinbr 31 Ianry          1708 Sir Your most obedient humble Servant Pat: Scott To The honorable Sir Isaac Newton Master and Worker of Her Majesties mint in the Tower London Lady Warwood in Kingstreet in Soho Lived with Mr Hunter a friend to my Lord {Isletons} whose Lad & servants can give a character.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of the 22th of December last, we have perused the annexed memorial of Mr Allardes the Master of her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh & humbly represent that the charges allowed to the Moneyers by her Majesties Warrant above 9d per pound weight Troy for coinage of silver are extraordinary & so are the charges of refining the coursest ingots of silver to bring the rest to standard: and therefore both these charges are in our humble opinion to be born by her Majesty out of the bullion for coinage belonging to that Mint & to be placed by the Master among the incident charges in his accounts. The extraordinary charges allowed to the Moneyers may amount to about three farthings per pound weight Troy, besides the charges of their journey. And we are further of opinion that for preventing any stop to the coinage the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of her Majesties Treasury in Scotland be desired to give orders from time to tim{e} to the Collector of the Bullion to pay upon account such summs of money to the said Master as they shall find sufficient for defraying as well the extraordinary as the ordinary charges of the coinage, & to direct the Wardens of that Mint to see that the moneys so paid be applied {by} the Master duly & in just proportion to every man's service without any {hindran}ce preference or neglect. As for the melting of the old moneys into ingots we are humbly of {the opinion th}at a penny per pound weight Troy is a reasonable allowance for the {melters} it being the usual price which merchants pay the Goldsmiths for melting {their} silver into ingots in London. But this allowance cannot be paid out {of the} bullion belonging to the Mint because this melting is no part of the coinag{e} {illeg} and silver ought to be in the ingot when imported into the Mint, & if i{t is} not in the ingot the owner causes it to be melted into ingots by whom he pleas{es} at his own charge & bears the loss by wast. And this must be done before the Master of the Mint can receive it from him by weight & assay upon his Note in order to coin it, & therefore is always done at the owners charge. According to this method the Importer did beare the whole loss by this melting in the late recoinage of the hammered moneys in England, & the same should be now born by the Importers in Scotland & placed among the losses mentioned in the Act of Vnion in these words. It is agreed that in the first place out of the aforesaid summ (that is out of the Equivalent) what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any losses which private persons may sustein by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coin of England may be made good. But her Majesties most honourable Privy Council of Scotland having appointed this melting of the old moneys into ingots, we humbly offer to your Lordships consideration whether it may not be proper for their Lordships if they think fit to appoint also the recompence for performing this melting.

The Agent of the Patentees sent us other Assay pieces cut off from Blocks melted in the Furnaces which were assayed also in the Tower by theDeputy  AssayMaster & found of the same goodness with the former. All these Assays being taken from west country Tin, where very little grain Tin is produced, none of them proved to be grain Tin: but the Patentees affirm that since they began to melt the several sorts of Tin apart, that is, in the three last coynages not yet sent to the Tower, a good quantity of their Tin breaks grain. Some  affirm that above one tenth part of all the Tin in Cornwal used heretofor to prove grain Tin, & think that the Furnaces of the Patentees by keeping the Tin too long in fusion evaporates the best parts of it & spoiles the grain Tin & damages the rest. And if this proves true we are humbly of opinion that the Patent is injurious to the Tin affair. But others represent that not above one twentieth part of all the Tin in Cornwall used heretofore to prove grain Tin, & that the Tin is refined from the drossy parts by being kept in fusion & thereby becomes better then before. And the Patentees tell us that their Agent in Cornwall hath by their Order kept a parcel of Tin in fusion in the heat of their furnaces some hours together & found it finer & better Tin after the fusion then before; whereas in their usual way of melting Tin out of the Oar, it continues in fusion but about a quarter of an hour. We having no Tin Oar nor Blowing houses & Melting houses to decide this important Question, do therefore humbly propose that your Lordship would please to give Order to the Agents in Cornwal, that this matter be there examined by taking out of the same heap of the black Oar of grain Tin, after it has been washed in the usual manner & made fit to be melted & is well mixed together, two equal parcels, & causing the one to be melted in a Blowing house, the other in a Furnace of the Patentees, & run into Blocks fit for coynage in the usual manner, and that the Deputy Assaymaster & such other sufficient Witnesses as the Agents in Cornwall shall think fit to  appoint do see that the whole proceeding in both the melting 
     <546v> house & the blowing house be done in the usual manner, & that the Blocks produced be assayed in their presence by the deputy Assaymaster, & the experiment of melting & assaying be repeated once or oftener if need by, for the greater certainty, & the whole matter reported by the said Agents to your Lordship. We also humbly propose that a parcel of good grain Tin be kept in fusion, in the presence of the same Witnesses, four or six hours, in that  heat of a furnace which is used in melting the Oar, & that  at the end of every two hours the molten Tin be well stirred  to mixt it  eavenly & two assays be taken out of the furnace one immediately before the stirring & another  presently after it & that these assays be compared by the Deputy Assaymaster with one another & with an assay-piece cut off from the Tin before fusion, to see whether & how much the Tin grows better or worse by the fusion & stirring: & a distinct Report thereof together with an account of the dross found in the bottom of the furnace by keeping the Tin in fusion some time after the last assay is taken out be sent by the Agents to your Lordship. We also desire that the Agents will please to inform themselves , as well as they can, of the quantity of grain Tin which used heretofore to be made annually in Cornwall in proportion to the other sorts of Tin, & of the quantity, or number of blocks, of grain Tin made the  last coynage by the Patentees, & give your Lordship an account thereof.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to us by Mr Taylor's Letter of  the 22th Instant upon the anexed Memorial of the General & other Officers of her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh concerning the Bullion given by Act of Parliament for maintaining a free coynage in that Mint & collected by Mr Daniel Stuart  now deceased & left in the hands of his Executors,  we have considered the same, & whereas there is a suspicion that the said Act of Parliament  may be expired by reason of the Act of Union establishing an equality of the duties of South & North Britain  we do not yet see how the said Act of Union repeals the  Act for raising the Bullion for the maintenance of her Majesties Mint in Scotland  since it does not repleale the Act for raising the coynage Duty for the the maintainence of her Majesties Mint in England. That the two nations may be upon an equal foot, either each nation must maintain its own mint or great Britain must maintain both Mints with an allowance to each  proportional to the taxes raised in each nation. And therefore we humbly offer it to your Lordships Consideration whether the Bullion of her Majesties Mint in Scotland should not be still collected & kept apart as formerly untill the opinion of her Majesties Council of both nations learned in the law can be had upon this matter if it be needfull And whereas the  Officers of her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh represent that they have received no salaries for the last half year nor any money has been lately issued to them  for defraying the charges of coynage,   so that the present coin <29v> age is in danger of being retarded or stopt for want of moneys to carry it on, we humbly propose that for the more speedy & effectual supplying the said Mint with moneys, your Lordship will please to authorize and direct Sir George Vshart & others the Executor or Executors  of  Daniel Stewart Esquire late Collector of the Bullion belonging to her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh to pay forth with out of the Bullion in his or their hands the summ of three thousand pounds to the General or Master of her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh upon account for the use & service of that Mint, we being informed that there is a greater summ in their hands, & that And we are further most humbly of opinion that her Majesties Warrant be directed to the Generall, Master, & Wardens of her Majesties said Mint & to her Majesties Cashkeeper or Receivers or such Receiver as your Lordship shal please to nominate, directing them to keep all such bullion as shall be impressed to the said Generall or Master,  in the Treasury of the said Mint  under one key to be kept by the said General or Master, two other keys to be kept by the Warden & Counter Warden & a fourth key to be kept by the said Cashkeeper or Receiver  & to issue thence such summs as shall become due quarterly for the payment of salaries & charges of repairs & monthly for defraying the charges of coynage  And we are further of Opinion that the Master of his Majesties said Mint do give security in her Majesties Exchequer for  making good accounts of such summs of money as shall be imprested to him for the service of the said Mint which security we humbly propose may be in 2000li besides his own bond. And whereas  the Executors of Mr Steward alledge that by the 15th article of the Treaty of Vnion, the recoynage of the moneys & the expences thereof should be made good out of the Equivalent, we are humbly  of opinion that the charges of melting the money into Ingots are a part of the loss which the people sustein in recoyning their money & therefore by the Act of Vnion ought in the first place to be defrayed out of the equivalent. But the charges of coyning the Ingots are to be defrayed out of the bullion belonging to the Mint. And lastly  whereas the Master the Warden & the Counter-Warden have each of them a new Clerk, but the salaries of these Clerks are not yet appointed: we are  <30r> humbly of opinion that  those said Master Warden &  Counter Warden may be allowed  salaries for these three new Clerks after the rate of 40li a piece per annum during  her Majestys pleasure, to commence from the 1st of August 1707.  All which  we most humbly propose to be done by her Majestys Warrant directed to the General Master & Wardens of her Majestys  Mint at Edinburgh & entred in proper Offices.   And if the  expences of melting the money into ingots  be  defrayed out of this fund at present,  it may be repaid hereafter to this fund out of the equivalent. But the equivalent in the proper fund for  defraying the expences of  melting  the old money into ingots. And if those  expences should be defrayed out of  this fund at present they may repaid hereafter to this fund out of such moneys as shall hereafter  arise to the equivalent. And where  it is suggested that since the Vnion these Impositions upon good which were to defray the  charge & expence of the Mint at Edinburgh are failed or repealed by the duties being made equal to those in England before the Vnion we humbly represent to your Lordship that it does not appear to us that the said Impositions are repealed.  to pay upon account to the  Master of the said Mint for the use & service thereof the said Bullion in his or their hands by such summs as shall be demanded from time to time by the General & Master of the said Mint to be kept in the Treasury thereof under the several keys of the  General Master Warden & Counter Warden of the Said Mint & issued out thence for payment of salaries & other charges of that Mint as the same shall become due & accounted for annually by the said Master according to the practise of her Majesties Mint in the Twoer   And if your Lordship pleases the Master of the said Mint at Edinburgh may give  security in her Majestys Ex{chequer} for making good accounts of all moneys imprested to him for the service of the said Mint. as is done in the Tower "

As to which Mr Allardes is very willing they be recalled whenever the Lord High Thesaurer thinks proper, Since it may be a Charge to keep them longer here And what further bullion may be brought in for coinage may be done by the Old Servants here. Mr Allardes likewise represents that the fond for the Coinage in Scotland will not only be found very far deficient to Satisfie the Charges of the Recoinage Tho it wer all brought in, But that it will even be a Considerable time befor what is lying out and due of that fond can be recovered from the Collectors and others liable for it, which is a loss to Mr Allardes He being obliged to make up the Wast on his own Credit, And it occasions him also to be deficient to the Moneyers In the payment of the Nine pence per pound weight according to their aggreement: Wherfor he begs also advice What he shall do for Satsifying the Moneyers, And to know if the Moneyers may obtain payment at London from the Thesaurer of what Ballance may be due to them Mr Allardes Certifieing the Ballance under his hand. As to the Moneyers Expences in coming to Scotland and their return home, And the allowance of 3 sh to Each per diem when they wer not supplied with work Conform to  their Commission These being reserved in the Commission to be payed by the Lord High Thesaurer in such method as he should appoint, Mr Allardes humbly thinks he cannot interpose in that mater further than to give a Declaration of the time when the work began and when ended and of the Extent of the Coinage in that time And how long the work was stopd the time of the former Assay Masters death, What else may be propper for him to do in this He will walk by Sir Isaacs advice He prays also to be advised in what method he shall apply for the triall of the Pix And to know If the Queen accompts to him both for the Pix and Assay peeces Since ther is a Considerable loss upon the Assay, For which end he has preserved all the assay peeces unmelted till he know If they be to be accompted for, As Some make him beleeve the Queen uses to do, b{y} taking to her self the Pix & Assay peeces and allowing the Value to the Master He prayes likewise to be directed in what manner he is to apply for having allowance in his accompts of the 9th penny paid the Moneyrs per pound weight It being a penny more than is allowed by the Indenture of the Tower. Also what allowance he shall crave or state in his accompts for the Miln horses  and their maintainance and Servants And for furnishing Rollers Upholding the files, cutters and tumblers or the Seising or Iusting peeces, fire for the nealing and blenching offices and for the moneyers room and Candles, allon and other necessaries to the moneyers. If on these accounts he ought not to be allowed So much upon the pound weight of the Coinage. Without being obliged to give in particulars which may be impracticable He desires further to know In what method to state the Refining And what allowance to crave per pound weight, The silver being returned of different fineness, Sometimes at 15, Sometimes at 13 Sometimes only 10 or 8 prymes He begs also to be informed if on the Recoinage in England Any {gratification} was given by the Government to the Officers Clerks and Servants for their extraordinary trouble, And if ther be any Encouragement to apply for the like, In what method it shall be Done [1] <177v> Ther being no allowance for maintainance of melters or L{abourer}s in this Mint otherways than when they are supplied with Work And ther being one Iames Sheelds a Melter here and very well Skilld in all the parts of the Coinage having wrought in the Mint these many yeares bygone whom the Officers here would willingly encourage It is earnestly also desired to know If he may not be setled as a servant in this Mint under the name of Purveyer or Such like with £15 Sallary And In what method that may be Effectuated Memoriall for George Allardes"

I have been slow to return an answer for fear that some of those things may be referred to the officers of our Mint with whom I find it sometimes difficult to agree & therefore what I now write to you  is to be looked upon  as coming not from an Officer of the Mint but from a private friend. I am of opinion that the Officers of your Mint should sollicit the Barons of the Exchequer to get the Bullion in the hands of the  Executors of Mr Stewar{t} & the under collectors to be paid into the Mint with all convenient speed & that as it comes in you should pay it in due course & order  discharging those debts first  which were first owing And when you have cleared all debts & accounts to any certain time (suppo{se} to Christmas or Lad{y} was a twelvemonth or Midsummer last,  or to any later time,) you may then make up & pass your accounts to th{at} time if you think fit, & afterwards you may pass your accounts annually according to the  course of the Mint in the Tower  taking care to clear all the accounts of every year before you make oath to them & pass them, because by passing them you are d{is}charged of all accounts till that time. As for the Moneyers, I am of opi{ni}on that the nine pence per pound weight should be paid them in course as money comes into your hands & that in your accounts the penny per pound weight above the 8d be set down in your accounts, & if the  Auditor or Barons of the Exchequer scruple it, you may petition my Lord Treasurer.  What else is due to the Moneyers on account of your coynage  they must petition my Lord Treasurer to be allowed. I beleive my Lord will scarce pay any thing to them at London, because   what is due to them can scarce come into any other account then yours The Pix & Assay pieces you are to  have & place them in your account as so much money received, & to bring in a bill of the loss of Assays. The Bill must be examined allowed & signed by the Warden & Counter-Warden. You should also according to the best of your memory & knowledge bring in one or more Bills of charges for the Miln horses & their maintenance & servants, & for furnishing Rollers, upholding the files cutters & tumblers,  & fire candles & allome & other necessaries for the moneyers. And this bill also should be examined & signed by the Warden & Counter Warden. And so should all the Bills of  Carpenters Brick laye{rs}  Masons Pairers Glasiers Smiths  Plaisterers &c I pay to the Smith of the Mint a farthing per pound weight  of all the  silver moneys coyned, for his making the Dyes, & wheth{er} the like allowance should be made by you towards {d}efraying the incident charges of the coynage I must leave to  consideration I conceive twelve pence per pound weight to the Refiner to be  sufficient for all the  silver refined to the degree of 17dwt & an half better & for every half penny weight which the refined silver want of this fineness,  a farthing may be abated out of the shilling, unless you can think of any exacter estimate."

For Athenagoras had said before {serm noster Beum lustum  celebrats conditore illium universilatis, qui} {ingenitus ipse (ni erum generari petist quod est sed quod non est,) omnia Verbo suo creavit}. He makes also the Holy Grail an emanation of the fathers  ot a necessary & eternal emanation but a voluntary & temporary one sometimes flowing from the farther sometimes returning back to him as the rays of the sun are emitted from him &  reflected back.  Of the very same opinion was Theophilus bishop of Antioch the Metropolis of the east, For in his second book to Autolycus he wrote thus Deus habens {summ} serononem ενδεα{φετον} internum in suis vesceribus  Carpocrates  who appeared in the reign of Adrian & {Antonieus} Pius ringleader & was coryphæus of the Grataes Gnosticks taught his son Epiphanes the Platonic philosophy & discipline, & whereas Plato  had said {illeg} he misunderstanding Plato taught that all mens wives were common.

The Petition of the moneyers was referred to us before I stopt it, which I was note aware of when I had the honour to see your Lordship last. We have since made a report upon it in which we set forth the weight of all the money coyned, the sum due to the Moneyers after the rate of 9d per lwt for the coinage, , how much they have received thereof & what remains due to them & that of the said 9d  Mr Allardes be allowed one penny per poundweight in his accounts by her Majesty, & beare only the other 8d out of his own allowance as is done in the  Mint in the Tower.   We have also reported what is due to the Moneyers  for journeys & other allowances So that I hope this Report will fully settle their account & procure a Warrant for paying it off {as} soon as there is money, & for authorizing Mr Allardes to place the penny per poundweight to her Majesty in his account    &  My Lord I understand that the Barons of the Exchequer of North Britain are calling in the money  due to your Mint from the Collectors of the Bullion,  & I hope there is good progress  made in that matter.  And as that money can be got in I presume my Lord Treasurer will order it for paying off the arrears of the late recoinage & the other charges {o}f your mint. And if any thing relating to this matter be referred by my Lord Treasurer to the Officers of the Mint in  Tower I shall be ready to promote the affairs of your Mint as much as I can. Since the Vnion of the two kingdoms there has been a Duty collectd in North Britain upon the same foot with the coinage Duty in England & the money collected (which is but a small summ) lies in her Majestys  Exchequer. I presume my Lord Treasurer will give order about it next winter  & also about the 12 hundred pounds applicable (by the new Act of Parliament) to the payment of salaries & charges of repairs. But during this vacation time, his Lordship being seldom at London & not yet having an account of the old arrears in the hands of the collectors of bullion, will be  difficult to get these matters settled. I wrote to Mr Allardes about two or three months ago to sollicit the Barons of the Exchequer to call in those arrears, & as soon as a full state of that matter can be laid before his Lordship  which I hope may be before  <166v> winter, I am humbly of opinion that it may be proper to draw up a memorial representing the arrears due to the Mint, &  moving  his Lordship for the payment thereof & for settling the payment {of} such further summs from  time to time as shall be  requisite for the support of your Mint for the future, & I believe it will be most proper to get the Secretary of State to lay the Memorial before his Lordship."

The assayer refines a small peice of any mass of Gold or Silver, and by the decrease of its weight makes his report, and if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the refined assay-piece, he reports (or ought to report) the Gold 24 carats fine and the silver 12 ounces fine, and this is fine Gold and fine Silver in the Sense of the Law. And all Gold and Silver of the same finenesse with the Assay piece is fine Gold and fine Silver in the sense of the Law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule than the Refiner and makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universall rule of Valuing Gold and Silver in all Nations in point of finenesse, and the Law in ordeining that standard. Gold shall be 22 carats fine and standard  silver 11 ounces two penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The Assay of Gold ought to be made with two waters and noe more this being the constant practice of assaying, and the waters ought to be of the usual strength (the Second Water stronger than the first) and to work the usual time and in the usual heat, and the assay-piece ought to be hammer'd to the usual thinnesse that the Assays may be uniforme, and the Assays of Silver ought to be made with a due proportion of lead in a due  and even heat, and as soon as the lead is blown off and the Silver looks bright and glittering, the Silver must begin to cool without roasting  it, and it must cool slowly that it doe not spring, But in refining Gold and Silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed. Assays are lyable to errors, but the errors are generally very small and seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in Gold and an half penny weight in Silver, and by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single Assays makes his report to noe lesse then a quarter of a grain in Gold and an half penny weight in Silver, But if two or more assays  be made of the same piece of Gold or of the same piece of Silver, and the assays agree without any considerable difference and a medium be taken between them, the finenesse of the Gold may be determined to lesse then half a quarter of a graine, and the finenesse of the Silver to lesse than an half penny weight, and this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use. 2 of making the Indented Trial-pieces  The Standard Trial-pieces are made by the assay. First a Iury of workmen summoned and sworn by Order of Council procures Gold and silver refin'd by the Refiner, and assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that is, the Gold just 24 carats fine and the Silver just 12 ounces fine, Then they melt this Gold and Silver severally with allay in due  proportion and stir them well together in fusion severall times to mix them very well with the Allay, and pour them off before the allay evaporates, and then assay them severall times to see if they be standard, taking  assays from severall places to see if the mixture be uniforme, It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards, one by the Assay-weights, the other by the Trial-pieces. Refiners find it difficult to refine Gold to the degree of 24 carats. they seldome make it above 23car: 3gr: 3qters: fine, and by fine Gold generally understand gold of this degree of finenesse, and if Gold at any time prove finer upon the assay, Assayers out of prejudice doe not report it finer, and thence it comes to passe that Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that Gold cannot be above 24 carats fine  not knowing that there are ways of making it finer then by the  assay. Thence alsoe it may have sometimes happened that at the making of tryal-pieces the Assayer may have reported the fine Gold not soe fine as really it was, and by that means the tryal-peice may have been made too fine. And if the fine gold was but 23car: 3g: 3qters: fine, 
         <109v> 
        The Trial-pieces may have been made too coarse, and there are other ways of erring, as by assaying with waters too strong or too weak or after any other unusuall manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or of the fine Gold or Suffering a sencible part of the Allay to evaporate or not mixing the Gold with the allay very well, or using a faulty crucible, or roasting the fine silver or suffering it to spring in the assay, And for avoiding these errors the Iury ought to consist of workmen very well skilled and exercised in assaying, refining and allaying of Gold and Silver.  3 of trying the Pix The tryall of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed by a Iury of Assayers in the presence of the warden Master & comptroller of the Mint after the most just manner that can be made by fire, by water by touch or by weight, or by all or by any of them, as is described in the Indenture of the Mint. The Pix is opened, and the Iury sworn before the Queen or such of her Councill as her Majesty shall appoint. If the tryal pieces be exactly made the tryal thereby is the most expedite and the least lyable to errors or fallacy. But a Tryal piece may happen to be erroneous, and then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull, soe alsoe they may be usefull, For the assay by the assay weights exactly performed will discover the error of the trial piece if there by any and how great that error is, and the assay by the touch may be also used to see how it agrees with the other assays, tho it be less exact and not to be depended upon alone. If at any time the Tryal-piece doth not agree with the Assay, either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported. If it be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorized to allow for the error in coining the money by that Trial-piece for the future or a New Tryal-piece must be made. If it must not be reported, the Mint-Master must goe on to coine the money by an erroneous Tryal-piece, and the Goldsmiths will have it in their power to alter the Standard without Controul as often as they are to make a New Tryal-piece and to make a New Standard instead of making a New Trial piece agreeable to the Standard established by Law. At the last Trial of the Pix the Gold money was Standard full by the Assay and the Trial-piece a quarter of a grain better than the money and the Iury in their Verdict represented the money a quarter of a grain worse than Standard by the Trial piece. This Trial piece was made upon the Union A: C: 1707 It was made (I think) without an Order of Council and by many assays very carefully made is by five twelfths of a grain better than Standard, That of 1688 made by order of King Iames II is a sixth part of A grain better than Standard, and  that of 1660 made by order of King Charles II is Standard.  Quære 1 If upon trying the Pix, the Trial-piece at any time doth not agree with the Assay, are not the Iury to report the Error. Quære 2 If any doubt arise about the manner of the report or verdict are not the Iury to make a Special report of the matter of fact and leave it to the Queen and Council to make a Judgment thereupon. Quære 3 If any doubt arise about the truth of the tale, weight, or assay, are not the Iury (Especially at the motion of the Officers of the Mint) to repeat the operation."

Silver  is assayed & refined by melting it with thrice its weight of lead & keeping it in fusion till the lead fumes away  with the base metals & The silver which remains is fine silver. If it be refined again with thrice its weight of Lead it becomes finer then before, the lead carrying away a little more of the base metals. But silver once refined is fine silver or silver 12 ounces fine by the laws of all Europe. And eleven ounces two penny  weight of this silver melted & well mixed with18dwt of copper makes standard silver by the law of England. And of such a mixture the standard trial pieces of silver ought to be made. Gold is assayed & refined by  adding  to it twice its weight of silver & melting the mixture with thrice its weight of led till the lead fumes away & carries away with it all the base metal & leaves the gold & silver alone, which being hammered into a thin plate & put into  hot aqua fortis, the aqua fortis eats away the silver & leaves the gold alone. If this aqua fortis be poured off & fresh aqua fortis be poured on, this second water (especially if it be a little stronger then the former)  will eat away a little more of the silver & leave the Gold finer then before. And a third water will leave it still finer, & a fourth still finer.  But Assaymasters & Refiners proceed no further then to two waters. Gold assayed or refined with two waters is fine Gold or Gold 24 carats fine by the laws of all Europe, & Eleven ounces of such fine Gold melted & well mixed with one ounce of allay  make standard Gold by the law of England: And of such a mixture the standard triall pieces of Gold ought to be made. The standard pieces should be made by the Queens Order, as the Indenture of the Mint expresses, but were made the last time (A. C. 1707) by the Lord Treasurers warrant. The Iury did not then refine the Gold & Silver but bought them off my Deputy Mr Carlich.  They know not how he refined them, and wondred that he could make them so fine:  But being generally of opinion that no gold or silver could be too fine, they made the trial pieces thereof for the money but absolutely refused to give receipts   of them  for making their plate thereby. And these Trial pieces were never yet established under the broad seal,   as they ought to be. And if they be established the Merchants will thereby lose about 4 or 5s in the pound weight of all gold imported."

May it please your Lordships  Finding reason to suspect  that the present indented trial piece is too fine; I have nicely examined it & find that it is finer then the last trial piece by about a quarter of a grain & that the last trial piece is also something too fine by the assay. Which excesses of fineness being of great consequence, I have further endeavoured to find out the reason thereof that the like accidents in making new triall pieces hereafter may be avoided. And by the assay I am satisfied that there are various degrees of fine gold, some being 24 carats fine by the assay, some a quarter of a grain  coarser or finer or above, & that gold may be refined so high as to be almost half a grain finer then 24 carats. And accordingly as the fine gold of which the standard pieces are made is finer or coarser the standard pieces will be finer or coarser in proportion.

to Her Majesties Mint in the Tower of London. Whereas by the Laws and Custome of the Mint it is Provided, that the Monyers belonging to her Majesties Mint in the Tower of London, shall take Apprentices, and instruct them in the Art and Mystery of Coining, to the end there may be never wanting a sufficient number of able and skilfull workmen to performe the service of the Mint. And Whereas Charles Stuart having for the term of Seven Years served the Monyers as an Apprentice, and during the time of recoining the Old Money performing the duty of an Apprentice, with all the Faithfulness and Diligence that such a time especially required: at the expiration of Seven Years Apprentiship, he was by the Provost and Society of Monyers admitted into the Fellowship of Monyers and in this capacity has constantly attended the service of the Mint for almost Eight Years. But some Years before his being made a Monyer, the Provost with the rest of the Monyers thought good to draw up certain Articles of Agreement for the better preservation of Society and good order among themselves, and whereby they obliged themselves, if they broke any of these Articles to pay some little forfeiture, the very highest of which was forty shillings: and seeing these Articles had no other end or tendency, than to keep up peace and good order in the Society, the said Charles Stuart when he was made a Monyer gave his consent to these Articles; and by these Rules thus voluntarily agreed to, the whole society has bin kept in mutual love and peace, for many years, till about two Years and a half ago New Iealousies broke out among them upon a very small occasion. The Honourable the Master Worker sending for the Provost to know the charge of coining Copper Farthings, and they not agreeing together upon the price, the said Provost came back full of Iealousy of the Master Worker, apprehending that he had a design to make a separate contract with some of the Monyers only that were willing to coin the Copper cheaper, and to exclude the rest. To defeat the Master Worker in his suspected design, this expedient was resolv'd upon by the Provost and the Monyers, To draw up a body of Laws in which the Old Articles should be inserted, with ye addition of several New ones; particularly one, and for the sake of which all ye rest were made, is to prevent the making any separate Contract; and an augmentation of the Penalty, from forty shillings which was the highest sanction of the Old Articles, to Five Hundred Pounds or any one that shou'd dare to act against any of these Laws. When this Project was mov'd first, the said Charles Stuart was surpriz'd to see how well it was receiv'd by a great part of the Monyers and therefore he desir'd em to consider well on what they did, and whether it was safe for them to enter into such a Combination: but notwithstanding all he said, these Laws were form'd, and every Monyer was required to sign em; but when it came to the turn of the said Charles Stuart, he declined setting his hand to any such Laws till he was better inform'd of their right and power to make them: Little was said to him upon his refusing it, for fear, as he imagin'd, talking too much upon the subject before all had sign'd might move some other to stand out: and therefore the Matter rested so above a Year. But last Lady day was twelvemonth it was taken up again. When the Provost told the said Charles Stuart to his greate Surprize, that the Salary which he and the rest of the Monyers enjoy by an Act of Parliament in that behalfe, and which by Your Honours care is paid as punctually, he the Provost would deprive the said Charles Stuart of till set he his hand to these New Laws; then the said Charles Stuart desir'd to have a Copie of the Laws that he might consider em; which allso was refus'd him, telling him he might read em himselfe, but they could not permit a copie of em to go abroad. But nothwithstanding this hard usage, of being deny'd a Copie of their Laws to consider before he sign'd em, and of having a whole Years Salary stopt in the hands of the Provost for not signing em, the said Charles Stuart has constantly attended the service of the Mint all along, and had he bin inclin'd by such strange treatment to neglect it, as he never was, yet as often as there was occasion, they called upon him to come to work, who were most zealous in refusing to pay him for his work; and for all that he constantly obeyd their call, tho as constantly as he applied himself to the Provost for his Salary, and the wages of so many days work he possitively refused to pay him either. At last this Proposal was made to the said Charles Stuart, that he should bring a proper Iudge to consider their Laws and both sides shou'd agree to abide by his Iudgment, If he aprov'd of em, then the said Charles Stuart shou'd be oblig'd to sign em; if he disapprov'd of em they shou'd be bound to cancell em; this Proposall the said Charles Stuart through his natural desire of peace accepted of; and accordingly Council was freed to read and examine these Laws, which being done the Council attended the Monyers at their next meeting, and gave his Iudgment against their Laws telling em among other things, that by the Charter and Indenture of ye Mint, the only Laws which they shou'd follow, the Monyers have no power to make New Laws, or even to punish the breakers of the old, that being given into the hands of none but the Warden the Master worker and comptroller who are empow'rd to punish all Offenders, whether the Provost the Fellows or their Apprentices as in reason and justice they shall think fit for her Majesties service according to the Antient Power and Authority of Right thereunt belonging: Whereas in this Case of Charles Stuart the Monyers have assumed a power even of making New Laws, and forcing all their Fellow Monyers to consent to em, and punishing the Refusers in a very extraordinary Manner, to Deprive a man of a salary granted him by the Authority of Queen and Parliament and yet employ him in the Service for which that Salary is granted : this and a great deale more the Council urg'd; that it wou'd be the safest way to Cancell their Laws, and be contented with the Old Laws of the Mint and the Powers Lodged with the Great Officers: And tho it was their own Proposal, they wou'd not keep to it, but insisted upon their former terms of the said Charles Stuart signing or no Salary: upon which ye Council advised the said Charles Stuart to make a demand of the Yearly Salary and other mony of his which they had in their hands, and he accordingly did demand it, and they peremtority refus'd to pay: the Regard which the said Charles Stuart bears to the Monyers and his Vnwillingnes to make any complaints against them to your Honours, would have gone a great way towards bringing him to comply with 'em almost in anything tho nere so inconvenient provided it was Lawful. But the said Charles Stuart has since bin assured by his Council that he can't set his hand to the Laws of ye Monyers Enacting, without doing the highest Injury to ye Officers, and Divesting the Warden the Master Worker and Comptroller of ye Powers which both Charter and Indenture of the Mint, they are justly possessed of, He therefore witholds the said Charles Stuart from setting his hand to these Laws; by these reasons following: 1st: Because ye Company of Monyers is but a part of the Corporation, the Warden the Master Worker and the Comptroller being the other more considerable part: 2d: Because one part of a Corporation has not a Power to make Laws without ye knowledge of ye other: 3d: Because the Power of punishing ties not in the hands of the Monyers where these New Laws wou'd Lodge it, but only in the hands of the superior Officers of ye Mint: 4thly: Even by these New Laws of their if the said Charles Stuart has done any thing that forfeits his Salary, the Monyers are bound to acquaint the Superior Officers with it that they may punish as their wisdom think fit. And 5thly: the Right or Interest of this Corporation is so far from being consulted in this Case, that by these New Laws that one part of ye Corporation Combines against the other; and whoever sets his hand to em enters into a Confederacy against ye Officers, for this was the first design of making these New Laws and this is the end they tend to. For these reasons among many others the said Charles Stuart is advised by his Council by no means to enter into such a Combination and as he is so great a sufferer upon that account, to lay his Case before Your Honours where it ought to Lye and where he is sure to find Iustice."

Qu 1. What is the proportion of the  English Troy weights to the Spanish weights used for weighing of gold & silver? A: Twenty ounces Troy weigh 9600 grains Troy & twenty ounces Spanish weigh about 8840 of the same grains. If the Gentlemen who are sent  as Commissioners from her Majesty into Spain  should carry with them a pound weight Troy with ounces penny weights & grains exactly made, they may weigh 20 spanish ounces at the  Spanish Mint & thereby determin the Spanish weights  exactly.  And it is to be observed that the Spanish pound consists of sixteen Spanish ounces, but the pound Troy conteins only twelve ounces Troy and this ounce conteins 20 penny weights & the penny weight 24 grains Qu. 2. What was teh weight of the 800000  Dollars? A.  A thousand Dollars as they are  brought by the Merchants from Mexico should weight 875 ounces Troy but the Merchants find that they usually weigh but 872 ounces at which rate 800000 Dollars should weigh 6976000 ounces Tory.  Let the books in Spain be examined where the weight of the 800000 Dollars was entred  upon delivery of the same. And say by the Rule of three, As  twenty ounces Troy to twenty ounces Spanish {so} is the whole weight of the Dollars in spanish to the whole weight in English ounces & so also is the weight of a 1000 Dollars in spanish ounces to the weight of a 100 in English ounces.  For example If the  English ounce should be to the Spanish ounce as 9600 to 8840 & the whole Spanish weight of the 800000 Dollars  should be found in the books to be 7574389 Spanish ounces, the whole English weight  will be found by the Rule of three to be   6976000 ounces Troy,   & the  weight of a thousand will be found 872 ounces Troy. And note that if the weight of a thousand prove to be 872 ounces Troy, or within an ounce or two over or under the delivering weighing & entring the weight of the 400000  Dollars may be presumed to have been fairly performed: but if a thousand weighs above an ounce or two less then 872 ounces,  there is reason to make further enquiry into the matter. For they were bought upon a supposition that a 1000 would weigh 875 ounces. Qu. 4 What ought to be the whole weight of all the Two-Ryal pieces coined out of  all the 800000 pieces of 8? Answ. By the assay I find that  Mexico Dollars  are 11 ounces 1dwt fine & two-ryal pieces are one per cent worse in fineness then  Mexico Dollars be encreased one per cent & you will have the whole weight of the Two Ryal pieces including the seigniorage As if the whole weight of the Dollars were 7574389 spanish ounces, the whole weight of the Two-ryal pieces ought to be 7650133 Spanish ounces. And note that Pillar  pieces  of 8 are about a penny weight better then the Mexico & so need not  be considered apart. Qu. 5. What number of Two Ryal pieces ought to be coined out of all the 800000 Dollars? Ans. By the weight of four of them which was  13dwt 12gr I found that one with another they weight about 3dwt 9gr Troy,  at which rate an 100 of them should weigh 16 ounces 17dwt 12gr Troy  Let 100 of them be weighed in Spain both in Spanish & English weight &  the weight will be had more exactly. And if another 100 & a 3d 100 be weighed & a medium be taken the weight will be had still more exactly. Then say by the Rule of three. As  the weight of an hundred (whether in English or Spanish ounces)  is to the number of an hundred so is the whole weight of the two Ryal pieces to the whole number of  them.
        
           Q. 3. What  was the  gross weight of  all the Ingots melted out of all the {8}00000 dollars? Ans. This weight may be found entered in the Books of the Spanish Mint or Mints where the Ingots were coined.  And  it may be also deducted pretty nearly from the weight of all the  800000 Dollars before melting. For  in the melting there is a wast some of the allay fumes away & some of the silver sticks to the melting pot & to the scales of iron which come of from the pott & to the coales which fall into the pott, & some of it will spring into the fire & be scattered among the ashes,  be spilt & by all this wast the Ingots will become lighter then  the money was before melting by about 12 or  23 or perhaps 34 or 78 per cent. And  out of the cinders & as as may be got  a considerable quantity of silver  be an operation which we call making up the sweep.  Which silver being added to the Ingots will make up the weight of the money wanting only about the three hundredth part of the weight. And by this proportion,  the weight of the  Ingots arising from the money & sweep may be gathered from the weight of the moneys & on the contrary, the weight of the money may be gathered from the weight {of the} Ingots.  For let the three hundredth part of the weight of the money be subducted from that weight & the remainder will be the weight of the Ingots proceeding from the money & sweep without any error worth considering. Or on the contrary, if the weight of all these ingots be known, let the three hundredth part thereof be added to it & the summ will be the weight of the money before melting. It must  be enquired therefore what silver has been got out of the sweep or what allowance  made to her Majesty for the same.  And if a doubt arise  about it: Let the weight of the moneys before melting be diminished by the 300th part thereof & from the remainder lett the weight of the Ingots produced by melting the moneys be subducted & the remainder is the weight of the silver which ought to be got out of the sweep  & this silver or the value thereof ought to be allowed to her Majesty by him who melted the moneys into Ingots. Sometimes the Melter  agrees at a certain allowance by the pound weight  of the old moneys melted down to bring in so much supply of silver of the same standard, as  being added to the Ingots shall make up the  weight of the moneys before melting. And this allowance should be about the 300th part of the value of the  silver melted. Quære 6. What was the charge of coining the 800000  Dollars into two Ryal pieces? Ans.  Besides the wast in the first melting of the Dollars into Ingots which as I said is about the 300th part of the silver melted, there is the charge of   that melting  to be recconed which charge in London is about a penny  for every pound weight of silver (or at least 78th of a penny)  that is, about the 800th part of the value of the silver melted. And there is also the Seigniorage  or Duty paid for coining the Ingots into two Ryal pieces.  In the Mint in the Tower before the making of the coinage Act they coined twelve ounces of silver into twelve crowns & two shillings & paid back to the Importer a crown for every ounce of silver imported & kept the two shillings for Seigniorage.   What the seigniorage is in the Spanish Mints I do not know.  Twenty one Mexico Dollars make 20 ounces  Spanish,   which makes it probable that  in the  Mints at Mexico, the Importer receives, back   out of the Mint a Dollar for every ounce imported    & the King    a Dollar in every twenty ounces for seigniorage And after the same rate  the Officers in King Charles mint  may retain 4 pieces for seigniorage  in every 20 ounces coined. For four of these pieces pass in Spain for a place of 8t. But what is the seigniorage in that mint must be known at the Mint it self. And enquiry should also be made whether the charge of the first melting & the want or either of them be not included in the seigniorage. Q. 7  What number of two Ryal pieces are the Queens Officers to receive out of the Spanish mint? Answ. The number received out will be found entered in the books of the Spanish Mint. And the number which ought to be received will be had by deducting the seigniorage from the whole number which ought to be produced by coinage. And if the charge of the  first melting not included in the Seigniorage but has bee  paid out of the new coined monies that charge must be also deducted. And note that 20 Spanish ounces  of silver in the Ingots make about 100 two ryall pieces  & if the seigniorage should ‡
        
         < insertion from the bottom of f 194v > ‡  be 4 of those pieces & all other charges about half a piece, there would remain to the Queen about 10512  two ryall pieces for every 20 Spanish ounces of Ingot, that is for every 21 Mexico & pillar Dollars. And at this rate her Majesty  for the  800000 Dollars should receive out of the spanish Mint about 4200000 two Ryal pieces. The charge of melting the Mexico Dollars into Ingots (if it be not included in the Seigniorage) is to be born by the Queen, & may amount to a two ryal piece for every  200 Dollars or to 4000 two ryal pieces for the whole. Qu. 8. What is the value of a new piece of 8t in Spain? Answer. 
               Since the year 1686 the Spanish money has been raised 25 per cent & new Sevil pieces of 8t coined accordingly
            
            
            
            About nine years ago I examined  two new Sevil pieces of 8 dated 1691 & 1700 & pound them standard & they weighed 14dwt wanting a grain or two & so were in value 3s 7d15 which is just four f{illeg} the {old} pieces of eight. These new pieces &c 
                
                These new pieces  for 8t Ryalls the {t}he Ryall pieces of King Charles must go in Spain for a quarter of these  new pieces.   And if the old Dollars have not been raised  in Spain from 8 Ryals to ten  but still go  only for 8 Ryalls,  (for I have not yet informed my self of this particular) then  four of the two-ryal pieces of King Charles must in payments be recconed equivalent to a Mexico  Dollar. I do not say that they are of equal value to the Refiner for the melting pot, but only of equal value in payments to the army & people of Spain.  – including the Seigniorage And so far as I am yet The seigniorage is a Duty paid by the Importer for coinage & how much it is must be know at the Spanish Mint. In the mint in the Tower before the making of the coinage Act, twelve ounces of standard silver were cut into 12 crowns & two shillings & the 12 crowns were deliverd for seigniorage Twenty one Mexico Dollars make 20 ounces spanish & {since} its probable that the Importer receives out of the Mexico mints 20 Dollars for his 20 ounces & a Dollar is deteined for seigniorage. At this rate four two Ryal pieces should be the seigniorage for coining 20 ounces in King Charles's mint. For  a Mexico Dollar or piece of eight is a piece of eight  Ryalls. About 25 years ago I examined two new Sevil pieces of 8t dated 1691 & 1700 & found them  standard & lighted by a fift part then the old pieces of eight. And these two-Ryal pieces by their name go for quarter pieces of eight,  being about a quarter of the new pieces of eight which go  for as much as the old ones. In twenty  spanish ounces of these new two-ryal pieces there are about 109 pieces of this money. If four of them be deteined for Seigniorage, the Queen should receive 105. Twenty ounces of Ingot has been allayed with the fift part of an ounce of copper or perhaps with a quarter of an ounce & so  should produce 11 pieces of two ryals or 11014. Therefore let the books of the Spanish mint or mints be examined to see what weight of Ingots has been coined, what allay has been put to the Ingots,  number of two-ryall pieces has been delivered out of the Mint for the service of her Majesty & what number has been deteined for seigniorage. Also let the laws of that mint be enquired into as to the weight & fineness of the money & the seigniorage & how far the master of that Mint or Mints has observed those laws. And particularly how it comes about that the two Ryal pieces are coarser by about 1 per cent then the Mexico Dollars, whether it be by the law if the Mint or by the error  of the Master & worker; &  how  it comes about that the two Ryal pieces are about four per cent lighter then a quarter of the new pieces of 8 or then a fift part of the old ones, or that 20 ounces make 109 pieces, whether it be by the law of the Mint or by the fault of the master of the Mint; & who has had the advantage of the lightness. For if the Master of the Mint has made any advantage to himself either by the  coarseness or by the highness of the money he ought to make satisfaction. As for instance, {if} by the {law} of the Mint Master {ought} to coin 20 ounces into 104 or 105 pieces & has coined them into 109 pieces, the question will be, Who has had the advantage of the excess "

He may buy bullion of uncertain value, but not knowingly to loss, & must account for the profit. But this way of buying of bullion is not in use. When plate or old moneys are to be coined the Importer either causes the same to be melted into Ingots at his own charge before delivery or delivers it to a general Importer who causes it to be melted into ingots, & the Master of the Mint receives the ingots by weight & assay to be coined. Or if Plate or old moneys be delivered in specie to the Master he either melts the same into ingots in the presence of persons appointed to see it done, or delivers the same by weight into the custody of persons appointed to carry it to the melting pot & deliver it back to him in Ingots by weight & assay to the coined. For the Master is not to be trusted with silver of uncertain value without due checks upon him. When the present Master & Worker was first spoken to about receiving the plate, he represented that he was ready to receive it & give receipts for the same by weight, & that some person or persons might be appointed to carry it from him by weight to the melting pot & to deliver back to him by weight & assay the ingots produced & keep an account of the meltings. This was the method of coining the Vigo plate. Some days after when the House of Commons voted an Address to her Majesty to give directions to the Officers of the Mint to receive Plate the Master of the Mint was perplexed thereat & told his fellow Officers that nothing more was to be understood by that Address then that her Majesty should give directions to the proper Officer or Officers, & accordingly prepared a Warrant for himself alone with blanks for the names of his fellow Officers to be inserted by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury if they thought fit. But the Warden of the Mint fell into a passion at the blanks & said he would not go into the Lords unless the blanks were first filled up, & at his desire they were filled up. Then the  Master prepared a distinct Warrant for himself as Master to coin the Plate, but the Warden opposed it. When the two Million Act was published & the Master alone (after a stay of some days for the concurrence of his fellow Officers) acquainted the Lord High Treasurer with the defect of the Act & in a second memorial, laid the state of the plate before his Lordship, & in order to a third memorial was informing  himself whether 5s per ounce would content the Importers till the Parliament met, & told the Warden that he found that it would: the Warden declared against it unless the Importers would deliver up their receipts upon payment of what the plate produced & take certificates for the remainder. Which the Importers being  <537v> averse from, the Master desisted till he heard that the Officers of the Mint would be summoned to attend his Lordship & then stated the  case to the Attorney General & brought the Attorneys opinion to his Lordship with the form of a Warrant for paying 5s per ounce to the Importers, being fully satisfied that it would have quietned them till the meeting of the Parliament if the Warden of the Mint would but have been content with an endorsement of the payments without taking back the Receipts given out for plate."

May it please your Lordship I humbly beg leave to lay before your Lordship a further account of the Tin. Mr Drummond by a Warrant dated Octob. 20th 1704, had 400 Tunns of Tin consigned to him & company at Amsterdam to be disposed of after the best rates not under 4412 Gilders per hundred weight of Holland (that is not under 4li 2s 4d per  Averdupois.) for a Commission of two per cent clear of all charges & advanced 22500li upon it at 4 per cent upon notice of its arrival at Amsterdam. And the like quantity was consigned to him Iune 8th 1705 on the same terms. The first parcel was sold in about 15 months, the second (by opening a trade over the Rhene into France) in about 9 or 10. And both parcels produced by sale 61714li clear of interest & all other charges except the duty of 3s per . Which produce is after the rate of 3li 17s 2d. Part of this money came in sometime after the sales. Mr Stratford & Mr Free, Feb. 20th 17045 had 240 Tunns of Tin consigned to Hamborough upon like terms, & upon notice of its arrival at Hamborough advanced 12000li upon it at 4 per cent. Sixteen blocks were lost by an insolvent chapman & the rest produced 18989li. 12s. 4d clear of interest & all other charges except the duty of 3s per . Which produce is after the rate of 3li. 19s. 112d per . And part of this money came in  after the sales. These Commissions were given for quickning the sale of her Majesties Tin while the Pewterers sold their own Tin to the Merchants at home. The present Commissions to sell when the time comes, are less advantageous then the former. There is no lowest price set. They interrupt the course of payments. And by the great quantity of Tin lying abroad put a  damp upon the Markets till the sale begins A merchant may have Tin here for 3li. 19s. per  including the duty, & will scarce reccon the shipping it off & carrying it to Hamborough at above 1s per . The Duty there & housing it may be 6d more, & the interest of the price till it arrives at Hamborough 3d. Tin therefore stands the Merchant in about 4li. 00s. 09d at Hamborough. And if her Majesty should sell it there to the Merchant for ready money at a set price, something must be abated of 4li. 0s. 9d to incline him to buy at Hamborough rather then at London. If 4li per  should be the price, & the charges of an Office for selling it, which would scarce be less then 1s 6d or 2s per , be deducted; the Queen would receive but 3li. 18s. 0d or 3li 18s. 6d per , & this without having any part of the money advanced If Mr Stratford will give after the rate of 4li. per , &

        within one month after the consignement of every 100 Tuns, for sale, advance the full price of 8000li: the bargain would be manifestly more advantageous then any of the Commissions above mentioned. For besides the duty of 3s per  saved to her Majesty, it would revive the market at Hamborough, bring in money by the sales, & diminish the Tin abroad, & her Majesty would run no risque of selling upon trust nor stay for any part of the money till debts can be got in. To take 100 Tunns at a time & pay here within a month is better by four or five months interest of the money then to take only 10 or 20 Tunns at a time for ready money at Hamborough besides the charges of an Office for selling it there. And as for the Objection of a monopoly, it lies as much against all the Commissions above mentioned. Merchants would not call it by this name, nor hath it the faults of a monopoly. Mr Stratford will not disable other Merchants from sending Tin to that Market if they can get by it, & a high price (which is the chief fault of a monopoly) would invite them thither. He might be enabled to undersell other Merchants by about 9d in the  (which would promote the sale) but not to raise the price of the market.  2.

And whether the number of Dollars & two ryal pieces which the Paymasters have charged themselves with in their Accounts be the same with the number  of Dollars received by the Melter for the melting pot & of two ryal pieces delivered from the Mint according to the Melter & the Mint. Or what evidence have the Paymasters ‡ < insertion from the bottom right > ‡by the books of Melter & of the Mint by Receips or Certificates or living witnesses < text from f 190r resumes >  that they have  <190v> caused all the Dollars received by them from the merchan{t} to be melted & coined & that they have charged themselves in their acco{un}ts with all the two ryall pieces which they have received from the Mint. If any dispute should arise in Spain about the coarseness of the two Ryall pieces which cannot be decided without an assay, the best way to  decide the Question by the assay is this. Let a pound weight  or half a pound weight of the two Ryall pieces be melte{d} into  a lump, & let the same weight of Mexico  & pil{lar} Dollars be also melted in a lump. Let assays be cut off from these two lumps by a skilful Assayer & weighed  by the assay weights for the fir{e} Let them also be weighed against one another in the assay-scales to see th{at} they be exactly of the same weight before they be wrapt up in lead.  And when the lead is blown off from the last let the fire abate gently of it self ti{ll} the silver is ready to congealleast the silver by cooling too suddenly spring into the fire..  And when the assay drops are taken out of the fire let them be weighed in the Assay scales against one another  exactly to find the difference of their weightAnd let one or two of the Commissioners (or persons appointed by them) see all this done.. Then say, As the weight of the assay drop of the two Ryal pieces is to the  weight of the  other assay drop so is the weight of the  fine silver in a pound weight of two Ryal pieces to the weig{ht} of the fine silver in a pound weight of the Dollars & so is  the weight of all the  Ingots of silver coined, to the weight of all the tw{o} Ryal pieces which ought to be produced out of those Ingots by coinage. And wh{en} they have the whole weight & the number of two Ryal pieces in 20 pound weig{ht} they will thence know the number of two Ryal pieces in the whole weight by the Rule of three. And when they have learnt at the Mint what propo{rtion} is to be taken for seigniorage,  they will know what number {t}{he} Paymaster ought to receive out of the Mint."

And the Quarter Moyder weighing 42 pounds at 7s. 7d12 And we humbly pray your Grace will please to take the first opportunity to obtain her Majestys pleasure herein because we are informed great quantities of those forreign coyns have been lately counterfeited in this kingdome to the damage of her Majestys subjects, which will be prevented for the future by making them current by Proclamation according to Law. We are My Lord Your Graces most humble Servants A true copy Edward Southwell. To the  Honourable the Earl of Oxford & Earl Mortimer Lord High Treasurer of great Britain May it please your Lordship According to your Lordships Order signified to me by Mr Secretary Harley in his Letter of 26 Feb. last, I have considered the Letter of his Grace the Duke of Ormond her Majestys Lieutenant General & General Governour of Ireland sent to your Lordship, together with the Representation sent to his Grace from the Lords of Her Majestys most Honourable Privy Council of that kingdom, mentioning a late Proclamation for making current in Ireland some pieces of forreign gold & proposing the making current there by further Proclamation several other pieces of forreign gold therein named in order to prevent the counterfeiting thereof. And as to the value of the pieces I humbly represent that the Spanish Pistoles one with another as they are brought hither by the Merchant, weigh 103 grains each at a medium, & are in fineness half a grain worse than standard, & after the rate that a Guinea is valued in England at £ 1. 1s. 6d are here worth 17s 1d & in Ireland where the silver money is raised a penny in the shilling, if they be raised in the same proportion, become worth 18s 6d.   And in proportion the Quadruple Pistole weighs 412 grains, the double Pistole 206 grains, & the quarter Pistole 25 grains & three quarters. But in the Representation the Quadruple Pistoles are said to weigh 408 the double 204 grains & the Quarter Pistole 2512 grains. Whence I gather that in the former Proclamation the weight of the Pistole was put 102 grains, which is a grain lighter then the just weight, this grain as I conceive being abated to give a legal currency to such lighter pieces as want not above a grain of their just weight. And upon this consideration the Quadruple Double & Quarter Pistoles may be put in weight and value as is exprest in the Representation. And so may the double and quarter Lewis d'ors, they being of the same weight fineness & value with the double & quarter Pistoles. The Moyders of Portugal one with another, as they are brought hither by the Merchant weigh 16534 Grains at a medium, & are a quarter of a grain better then standard, & in England are worth 27s. 8d12, & being raised a penny in the shilling become worth 1li 10s– in Ireland. In the Representation their weight is put 168gr which is certainly {too} much, & thence it comes to pass that they are therein valued at 1li 10s 6d which is 6d too much. I have examined the weight of 30 parcels of Moyders conteining a thousand Moyders in each parcel & thereby found that the Moyder at a medium weighs only 165 grains & three quarters. If in favour of the lighter pieces the fraction be abated their weight & value in a new Proclamation may be put as follows. The Portugal piece of gold called a Moyder & weighing 165 grains to pass at 1li 10s –. The half Moyder weighing 8212 grains at 15s & the Quarter Moyder weighing 41 Grains & a quarter at 7s. 6d. Gold is over-valued in England  in proportion to silver by at least 9d or 10d in a Guinea, & this excess of value tends to increase the gold coins & diminish the silver coins of this kingdom. And the same will happen in Ireland by the like overvaluing of gold in that kingdom. But its convenient that the coins should bear the same proportion to one another in both kingdoms for prev{e}nting all fraudulent practices in those that trade between them, & that the proportion be ascertained by proclamation All which &c"

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to me by Mr Taylour in his Letter of Iune 16th Instant, I have perused the Representation from the Lords of the Privy Council of Ireland touching a late Order of Council here for giving currency in that Kingdom by Proclamation to some forreign Coynes which were omitted in a former Proclamation, a printed copy of which they have sent, desiring a clause to be added to the said Order for making such {allowan}ce for light pieces as was made in the said Proclamation, & that {the Order} may comprehend also the forreign coynes mentioned in that  {Proclamatio}n because the original therof under the great seal was destroy{ed in the} late fire which happened there at the Council Chamber, so that {the Cler}k of the Council cannot now certify that the printed copy {agrees wi}th the original verbatim as the late Act of Parliament requires {for} the conviction of counterfeiters of those coynes. And upon comparing the said Representation with the said late Order of Council & printed Proclamation, I humbly represent that the weight of the single Pistole & Lewis d'or being in the said Proclamation put 4dwt 8gr, the weight of the double Pistole & double Lewis d'or ought in proportion to be put in a new Proclamation 8dwt 16gr & that of the quadruple Pistole or double doubleon 17dwt 8gr. And that  the Moyder of Portugal (which as the Merchants bring them hither a little worn weigh one with another 6dwt 2134gr, & before wearing may be a quarter of a grain heavier or above) may be put in weight 6dwt 22gr in the same Proclamation & valued at thirty shillings. For in Ireland where an English shilling passes for thirteen pence the Moyder of this weight is worth 29s 1112d reconning gold 22 carats fine at 3li 19s 834d per ounce which is the standard value, or it is worth 30s 0034d reconning gold 22 carats fine at 4li per ounce as is ordinarily done: and 30s is a medium & the nearest round number. And a grain being allowed for wearing, this piece will be current till it weights but 6dwt {21}gr as was stated in t{he} late Order of Council. And after that it will be current still by abating 2d per grain in its value for what it wants to the weight of 6dwt 22gr. For the latter part of the printed Proclamation concerning the allowance for light pieces & concerning the scales & weights for weighing them, I am humbly of opinion should be continued in the next Proclamation. I humbly beg leave to represent further to your Lordship th{at the} weights & values of the silver coynes in the printed Proclamation would answer better to   one another & to the coynes themselves if two pence were taken from the value of the Crusado & eighteen or twenty grains added to the weight of the Dollars. For the Crusado is reconned in Portugal to be the tenth part of the Moyder in value & the Moyder is worth 30s in Ireland as above, & yet the Crusado is valued in the Proclamation at 3s 2d. Its weight before wearing is 11dwt 4gr. In the Proclamation its weight is put 10dwt 20gr, & a  <242v> Crusado of this weight is worth but three shillings.  Rix Dollars Cross Dollars & other Dollars are in the Proclamation put of the same weight & value with pieces of eight of Mexico & Sevil, Pillar pieces & Lewises. And yet the Dollars are much coarser & heavier than the pieces of eight & Lewises & ought to be 18 or 20 grains heavier to be of the same value. Rix Dollars before wearing weighed about 18dwt & 6 8 or 10 grains & Cross Dollars 18dwt 1gr. That they may be worth 4s 9d (which is their value in the Proclamation) they should weigh at least 17dwt 18gr. I am therefore humbly of opinion that the gold coines should be of the weight & fineness expressed in the Paper hereunto annexed, & the silver ones as in the printed Proclamation, unless for the reasons above mentioned it should be thought fit to take two pence from the value of the Crusados & add eighteen grains to the weight of the Dollars.

Instant wee humbly Lay before Your Lordships the following Extract of the several proposals that have been Referd to this Office since Her Majestys Accession to the Crowne for making half pence & farthings and of the Reports that have been made thereupon Vizt. Abel Slaney Citizen and Woollen draper of London as principal undertaker for the coining half pence and farthings in the Reign of the late King and Queen alledging that He was a very great Sufferer in the Changing of Tin half pence and farthings for Copper by Tale, proposed in the year 1703. to Coin 700 Tun of Copper half pence and farthings in seven years of Equal value, weight and fineness of the last half pence and farthings to be melted, rolled, cut & stamped att Her Majestys Mint in the Tower, subject to a Comptroller to be appointed by Her Majesty, and at the undertakers Expence. In Consideration of such grant the said Slaney for himself & partners proposed to give Her Majesty a Fine of 5000li and a Rent of 1000li per Annum by Half yearly payments and to be under such Restrictions & Regulations as Her Majesty should think Reasonable Thomas Renda Esqr. Edward Ambrose & Danl: Barton, who were before p{artners} with the said Slaney in Coining the former half pence & farthings underst{anding} that the said Slaney designed to Intitle a new sett of partners to the Merit {of a} patent upon the termes by Him proposed did petition that if Her Majesty th{ought} fitt to grant a new pattent for making Copper half pence & farthings, Strang{ers} might nott reap the Benefitt of the Expences they had been att in performing {the} pattent which they pretended was done to their Loss, butt that they might ha{ve a} new pattent paying for the same what was proposed by others. Will Shepherd, N Shepard and Geo: Freeman did in March 17045 petiti{on to} have a patent to Impower them to Coine forty or fifty Tunns every year for {Eight} or Ten years obliging themselves to make them of English Copper of equal Wei{ght &} fineness with those now Currant. The fellow Monyers being poor and needy and haveing no Worke in the {Mint} did about the same time petition to the same effect that out of the profitts of suc{h} Coinage they might sustain themselves until the Mint was sett to work about {gold} and silver Moneys. Soon after the union Sir Talbot Clerk and partners did represent that hav{ing} in the year 1686 obtained Letters patents for 14 years to putt in practice a {new} Invention of Furnaces for melting and refining Metals out of Oars and tha{t by} their Care and Expence great Advantage had Acrued to the Nation but that {by} reason of great Difficultys they mett with in the Management and the ti{me} being Expired they had nott made the hoped for Advantage they therefore did petition that in some Recompence for their Charges and Expences they might {send} in two Tunns of Copper Blanks per week into the Mint untill they had Disp{osed} of seven Hundred Tunns. Mr. Chambers hearing of this proposal of Sir Talbott Clerk represent tha{t} He and divers other persons had purchased at a very dear rate of the said Sir Ta{lbot} Clerk and others concerned with him their Interest in the said pattent and were afterwards incorporated by King William and Queen Mary under the Name of the Governour a{nd} Company of Copper Mines in England And that having very much Improved the Copp{er} Works and at the Charge of above £20,000 having obtained the knowledge of ma{king} copper fine and having a greater stock in his hands then could be disposed off did p{ropose} to send 100 Tuns of Copper into the Mint at the rate of 12d per pound to be there Coi{ned} into half pence and Farthings at such value as should be directed so that the Cha{rge} of Coining the same & other Incidents might be born out and that He might have {12d} per pound to be paid to Him as fast as the Copper money should be disposed off. William Morgan Gent. and others did in the year 1708 petition for a grant f{or} Coining 1000 Tuns of English Copper one half into half pence and the other half in{to} farthings and half farthings within the Terme of seven years to be of Weight and Fin{eness} according to a standard to be agreed to which standard was to be at least 20li per cent {finer} and better copper then the 700 Tuns formerly coined: And was to be melted Assayed rolled cutt and stamped at the Mint in the Tower subject to a Comptroller to be appointed by Her Majesty and at the Expence of the Vndertaker By this proposal all the Copper half pence & farthings formerly Coined were to {be} taken in & Exchanged by the proposer in tale for those of the new stamp & so melted {down} Mr. William Palmes in the year 1710 did petition that towards a Recom{pense} for Losses He had sustained he might have a pattent for the Coining 700 Tuns of {Copper} in fourteen years subject to such Agreement Limitations & Covenants as were m{ade} in the pattent granted for the Coining the former 700 Tuns. The several Reports that have been made upon those respective petitions and proposals have all been to the same Effect humbly setting forth that all the Coinages of half pence and farthings since the year 1672 vizt in the Reigns of King Charles the 2d. King Iames the 2d. and in the Beginning of their late Majestys King William and Queen Mary were performed by Commissioners who had Money Imprested from the Exchequer to buy Copper and Tin and Coined at most at 20d per pound Avoirdepoise and Accounted upon Oath to the Government for the Charge and produce thereof by Tale That upon Calling in the Tin farthings and half pence by reason of the Complaints made against them A pattent was granted to Sir Ioseph Herne & Others who contracted to Change the same and to Enable them to bear that Charge they were allowed to Coine 700 Tunns at 21d per pound weight with a remedy of a half penny without being Accountable to the Government for the Tale the reason of which allowance ceasing Wee have all along been humbly of Opinion that the said pattent was nott to be drawn into president, especially since the money made thereby was light, of bad copper, and ill coined. Wee have further humbly reported that its best to coin the copper money as near as can be conveniently to the intrinsic value including the Charges of coinage sett Allowances and Incidents and reckoning the Copper att what it would sell for if the new Money should be melted down Again for which reason itt ought to be free from such mixtures as diminish the markett price And that what ever profitt arises by the Coinage Her Majesty may have itt in Her power to Gratifye whom she please therewith And therefore the former Method by Commission and upon Account seemed the more safe commendable & Advantageous to the Government, especially if the Method used in the Coinage of Gold and Silver be observed as near as can be conveniently in the Coinage of Copper For thereby the Coinage may come nearer to the Intrinsic Value and will be better performed and of better Copper and by a standing Commission any Quantity may be Coined at any time as the uses of the Nation shall from time to time require for preventing Complaints Fir in the times of the Petitions & proposals above mentioned there was at first no want & afterwards no Considerable want of Copper Money and itt was thought safest to coin only what was wanted least the Coinage of too great a Quantity of once should occasion Complaints as it did actually in parliament in the Coinage of the first six Hundred Tuns of the present Copper Money. And further upon the petition of Mr. Morgan there was a Verbal Report that to call in all the Copper Money then Currant would be a Loss of 70 or 80 Thousand pounds to the Government or above: and that a Thousand Tunns were too much six or seven Hundred Tunns being found sufficient to stock the nation of England. And to an Argument of the petitioners that a new Coinage of weightier and better money would cause the Old Money to be rejected by the people and lose in Currancy it was Answered that a great Coinage suppose of 600 or 700 Tuns might have that Effect because alone sufficient for the uses of the Nation but a small coinage nott sufficient for that purpose was best. This is the Tenour & Substance of the Reports which have been made upon the petitions & proposals referred to this office during Her Majestys Reigne All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great Wisdom Craven Peyton Is.

            Vndertaker for the Coyning half pence, & farthings in the Reign of the late King 
            & Queen, alledging that he was a very great Sufferer in the changing of Tin 
            half pence & farthings for Copper by tale, proposed in the year 1703, to Coin 700 
            Tun of Copper half pence and farthings, in Seven years of Equal value, weigh{t}
and fineness with the last half pence and farthings, to be melted, rolled, cut & stamp{ed}
at Her Majesty's Mint in the Tower, subject to a Comptroller to be appointed 
            by Her Majesty, and at the Vndertakers Expence. In Consideration of such Grant; the said Slaney for Himself 
            and partners proposed to give Her Majesty a fine of 5000li and a Rent of 
            1000li per Annum by half yearly payments, and to be under such Restrictions and 
            Regulations as Her Majesty should think Reasonable. Thos: Renda Esqr: Edward Ambrose, & Daniel Barton who 
        were before Partners with the said Slaney in Coining the former Halfpence & 
        farthings, understanding that the said Slaney design'd to Intitle a new sett 
        of partners to the meritt of another patent upon the Terms by him proposed, 
        did petition that if Her Majesty thought fitt to grant a new Patent for 
        making copper half pence & farthings, Strangers might not reap the Benefit 
        of the Expences they had been at in performing the former Patent which the{y}
pretended was done to their Loss, but that they might have Such new Patent 
        paying for the same what was proposed by Others. Willm: Shepherd, & N Shepard  did in March 17045 petition to have 
            a Patent to Impower them to Coin forty or fifty Tuns every Year for Eight or 
            Ten Years, obliging themselves to make them of English Copper, of equal Weigh{t}
and fineness with those now Currant. The fellow Monyers being poor & needy, & having no Work in 
            the Mint, did about the same time petition to the same Effect, that out of the 
            profitts of such Coinage, they might sustain themselves until the Mint wa{s}
sett to Work about Gold and Silver Moneys. Soon after the union Sir Talbot Clerk and partners did 
            Represent that having in the Year 1686, Obtained Letters Patents for 14 
            Years to putt in practice a new Invention of Furnaces, for melting and 
            refining Metals out of Oars, and that by their Care and Expence great 
            Advantage had accrued to the Nation, butt that by reason of great difficultys 
            they mett with in the management & the time being expired they had not made 
            the hoped for Advantage, they therefore did petition that in some Recompence 
            
             <404v> 
            
            for their Charges and Expences they might Send in two Tunns of Copper 
            Blanks per Week into the Mint untill they had disposed of 700 Tunns. Mr. Chambers hearing of this proposal of Sir Talbott Clerk, represented 
            that He, and divers other Persons had purchased at a very dear Rate of the said 
            Sir Talbott Clerk and others concerned with him their Interest in the Said 
            Patent, and were afterwards Incorporated by King William & Queen Mary, 
            under the Name of the Governors and Company of Copper Mines in England. And that having very much Improved the Copper Works, and at the 
        charge of above 20,000li. having obtained the Knowledge of making Copper 
        fine, and having greater Stock in his Hands, than could be disposed off, did 
        propose to Send 100 Tun of Copper into the Mint at the rate of 12 pence per
        pound, to be there Coined into half pence and farthings, at such Value as 
        should be directed, So that the Charges of coining the same & other Incidents 
        might be born out, and that he might have 12 pence per pound to be paid to 
        Him as fast as the Copper money should be disposed off. William Morgan Gentleman and others did in the year 1708 petition for a 
            Grant for the Coining 1000 Tuns of English Copper, one half into half pence, & 
            the other half into farthings and half farthings within the Term of Seven 
            Years, to be of Weight and fineness according to a Standard to be agreed to, 
            which standard was to be at least 20li per Cent finer and better Copper than the 
            700 Tuns formerly coined, and was to be melted, assayed, rolled, cutt & Stamped 
            at the Mint in the Tower subject to a Comptroller to be appointed by Her Majesty 
            and at the Expence of the Vndertaker. By this proposall all the Copper half pence and farthings formerly 
            coined were to be taken in, and Exchanged by the proposer in Tale for those of 
            the new Stamp and so melted down. Mr. William Palmes in the Year 1710 did petition that towards 
            a recompense for Losses he had Sustained, he might have a patent for the 
            coining 700 Tuns of Copper in 14 Years Subject to Such Agreement, Limitations and Covenants as were made in the Patent granted for the coining the 
            former 700 Tuns. The Several Reports that have been made upon those respective petitions 
                and proposals have all been to the Same Effect humbly setting forth that all the 
                Coinages of Half pence and farthings Since the Year 1672 vizt. in the Reigns of 
                King Charles the 2d. King Iames the 2d. & in the Beginning of their late Majestys 
                King William and Queen Mary, were performed by Commissioners who had 
                Money Imprested from the Exchequer to buy Copper and Tin, and Coined at 
                most at 20d per pound Avoir de Poiz and Accounted upon Oath to the Government 
                for the Charge and produce thereof by Tale. That upon calling in the Tin farthings and half pence by reason of the 
                Complaints made against them, the Patent was granted to Sir Ioseph Herne & others, 
                who Contracted to change the Same, and to Enable them to bear that charge, they 
                were allowed to Coyn 700 Tuns at 21 pence per pound weight with being 
                accountable to the Government for the Tale, the reason of which allowance 
                ceasing we have all along been humbly of Opinion that the said Patent was 
                
                 <405r> 
                
                not to be drawn into President, especially since the money made thereby 
                was light, of bad copper, and ill coined; and that the former method by Commission is most advantagious to the Government, especially if the same Method be used for Coyning Copper that is observed for Gold and Silver so far as is practicable. And pursuant to an Address of the House of Commons to his late Majesty King William in the Year 1694. we have further humbly reported that we are of Opinion that the Coynage of Half pence and farthings should be to the Intrinsick Value, the Charges of the Coynage & Incidents deduced, To the End there may be no more temptation or Incouragement to Counterfeit them than was absolutely necessary, and that they should be well Coined to make it difficult to Counterfeit them, and be of good malleable Copper of a Certain Standard. And whereas in the last Coinage of Copper money the Coinage of 600 Tuns occasioned great Complaints in parliament so as to procure a Stop to that Coinage for one Year; we have been further of Opinion that for fear of new complaints no more new Copper money should be added to that already Currant than what  people will voluntarily take off. And further upon the petition of Mr. Morgan there was a Verbal Report that to Call in all the Copper money then Currant would be a loss of 70 or 80 Thousand pounds to the Government or above. This is the Tenour and Substance of the Reports which have 
        been made upon the petitions and proposals referred to this office during 
        Her Majestys Reigne. All which is most humbly submitted to Your Lordships great Wisdom."

That six or at most seven hundred Tunns of Copper moneys are sufficient for all England, & I am of opinion that there is above three quarters of that quantity now in the nation. 2. That whenever there shall be a coinage of such moneys, the coynage do not exceed 20 or 30 or at most 40 Tunns per an. For this money should have time to spread eavenly without making a clamour any where before the nation be sufficiently stockt. 3. That it be in the power of the Queen or Lord Treasurer to diminish or stop the coinage at pleasure for preventing clamours if there should be occasion. 4. That the moneys be coined in the Mint, it being unsafe to have coining Tools & coinage abroad. 5. That the moneys be well coined & a pound weight cut into {no} more then twenty pence, least the ill form or lightness of the money be an encouragement to counterfeiters. 6.That about one seventh part of the moneys be in farthings. The first 20 or 30 Tunns may be all in farthings because they are wanted. 8. That the Master & Worker for the time being be charged & discharged by his Note as in the coinage of gold & silver. 9.That all the charge of copper, coinage, coining tools, wages & incidents be paid out of the profits of the coinage 10. That the copper be paid for out of the produce of the coinage within two three or four months after delivery 11. That if the copper upon the assay be not good the Master have power to refuse it. 7. That on{e} or more persons be appointed to buy & import the copper by weight & receive it back  in money by weight & tale & put the same away 1{3}. That the Master for the time being be allowed 5d per pound weight for coinage by casting the blanks, or           per pound weight for coinage by casting milling & sizing of barrs & cutting out the blanks, as is done in the coinage of gold & silver 14. That the surveyor of the meltings be paid by the number of melting days & the Tellers by tale 12 That the copper be coined without any mixture which may diminish its price in the market if hereafter the moneys should be called in & melted down. For the price of the metal in the market is the intrinsick value of the money. And that not above three or four ounces of Tynn be added to an hundred weight of copper in fusion to make it run close. 15 That the Importer above mentioned be paid by the Tunn for all trouble & charge in buying & importing the copper & for coinage & porters & barrels & baggs & paper & packthread & for putting away the copper money & making up the account, & that he bring in no particular account for any of these things. 16. Or if the Master be the Cashier & makes up the account, that he be allowed for his trouble & hazzard therein 18. If her Majesty should think fit by Patent to grant away the profit of the coinage above all charges, there will be no need of an Accountant or Teller or other Importer then the Patentee. But it was thought fit in the reigns of King Charles & King Iames that the coinage should be upon account. And the copper & coinage will be the better if paid for by her Majesty. And the profits above the account may be given to whom her Majesty pleases if it be thought fit. 17"

And these pieces are of the same allay as the former & of the same weight with english Crowns & Guineas abating a few grains for the charge of coinage. That  before the conquest of Lisle by the Dutch   money was returned by the French to  Dunkirk by Lisle & the value of the several coins at Dunkirk was regulated by their value at Lisle in livres  sous & deniers. But since the conquest of Lisle  the Dutch have  introduced their own way of  valuing the several coins by skillings & deniers or Gilders & styvers. That at present there is no course of exchange by the Merchants of either England or Holland with Dunkirk: but moneys may be returned to  Lisle or Antwerp & carried thence in specie  to Dunkirk at a small charge. That if moneys be returned to Antwerp or Lisle  under the denomination of Guilders & Styvers & carried thence to Dunkirk & paid there to her Majestys forces  according to the value put upon the several species of moneys at Antwerp or Lisle, recconing 10 Guilders 15 styvers to a pound English, there will need no new authority for paying her Majestys forces at Dunkirk. And this method may be continued till a better can be  setled. That the money of Holland & Flanders is valued higher at Lisle & Antwerp in proportion to French money then at Dunkirk & thereby there will be some loss in carrying such money to Dunkirk. And new French money in not yet to be had  in quantity in Holland  & Flanders if it can be had there in quantity & sent that to Dunkirk. But forreign Bullion may be bought of the Merchants & sent to Dunkirk to be coined, & paid to the forces at Dunkirk reconning a new French crown at about two or three per cent above its intrinsic value in English money or perhaps at 5s English & a new liver at 1s.

They that Work Copper from the Oar when they have brought it to such a degree as they call fine copper, sell it to those who have Mills for manufacturing it and expose it to sale in their Warehouses in London and such Copper is worth from 95li to 100li per Tun and very little of it is worth above 100li per Tune. This is commonly called fine Copper But that of 05li. per Tun will scarce hammer without cracking and then it is worth about 1112 per pound weight or about 107li per Tun or thereabouts. Refiners of Copper by refining a small part of any Mass can make an Estimate of the Charge of Refining the whole mass and how much fine Copper it will produce But the best Way of making such an Assay is not yet agreed upon when it shall be agreed upon & brought into Common use it may be then considered whether the Master and Worker shall be allowed to buy course Copper by such an Assay and putt it out to Refine it with publick money and what he shall be allowed in his Accounts for the refineing thereof according to the several degrees of the Courseness, and what for the waste by evaporation, In the mean time the Master or any other person may buy course Copper, put it out to be refined and send it to the Mint to be Coined. The Malleability of the Copper depends not only on the fineness of the metal or freedom from other Metals but also upon the manner of refining it for if it be refined with seacole it will nott be Malleable and fitt for working though it be fine It may be refined with sea coale till it begins to be fine and then it must be wrought with charr'd coale till it be fully fine and the charr'd Coale of Wood is better than sea coal charred. Also the melting diminishes the Malleability, especially if it be melted with too much heat And for these Reasons the Assay by the Hammer is the best and surest for the Mint. If it shall be thought fitt that Copper Money be made of such copper as in hammering when red hott will crack butt not fly in pieces, it may be brought at the Copper warehouses in London; if of such Copper as will hammer red hott without cracking it must be had of those who refine Copper. In the Reign of King Charles the Second a pound weight of Swedish Copper was cutt into 20{d} the Copper and making the Blanks cost 18d. the stamping 1d and a penny remained for other charges; this Copper was malleable so as to hammer red hott without cracking If it be thought fit that the Money now to be coined by of like fineness so as to endure the same teste the Copper will cost 11{d}12 per pound weight as above and hte Coynage about 6d or 6d14 without edging or 7d. with edging And if a pound weight not edged be cutt into 20d or a pound weight edged be cutt into 21d there will be an Excess of 2{d}12 per pound weight for purchasing Mills and presses and Cutters and flatter and setting up a Copper Mint and paying Clerks and incident charges of Assaying, weighing, telling, porterage, baggs paper and packthread, putting off, &c. But if it be thought that the Copper be only so fine as to endure the Hammer when red hott without flying in pieces tho not without cracking a pound weight may be cutt into 19d not edged or 20d edged. The Mills and Presses and other Engines for setting up a Copper Mint will cost six or seven hundred pounds and three farthings per pound weight in Coining an hundred Tuns will pay that charge And when that charge is paid the weight of the money may be a little augmented. If the Blanks be so thick or the Impression rise so high as to straine the Dyes or Cutters and make them more apt to breake then in the Coinage of Gold and Silver or the casting into Barrs prove so difficult as to make above one half of the Barrs become scissell, the charge of Coinage must be proportionably augmented for which reasons the Charges of Coinage cannot be positively sett without Experience in Coining some Tuns of Copper Money. The Weight of all the Copper received and the Weight and Tale of all the copper money coined may be Entered into Books and in the Accounts of the Master and Worker and the surplus above all charges may be paid into the Exchequer. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great Wisdome Ianry: 22d: 1713"

        & farthings of an artificial metal which toucheth like ordinary 
        gold & for cutting a pound weight averdupois into 32 pence: We 
        humbly represent That the selling blancht copper or making it for sale is 
        forbidden by law upon pain of death because of its fitness to be 
        used in counterfeiting the silver moneys: & for the same reason 
        it may be of dangerous consequence to encourage the making of 
        an artificial metall which toucheth like gold & is used in making 
        sword hilts & other wares in imitation of gold. The halfpence 
        made of this metall & melted down with a little fine gold may 
        make a composition very dangerous for counterfeiting the gold 
        moneys. That in the last coinage of copper moneys an hundred Tunns 
        per annum at the end of six years occasioned great complaints in Parliament 
        so as to cause the coynage to be stopt for a year. And after another hundred 
        Tunns were coined the nation was overstockt for four or five years. And 
        therefore six hundred tunns may be deemed sufficient for the use of all England, 
        whereof there seem to be about 500 Tunns already current. That the secret of making this metal being known only to the 
        Petitioners, it has no known intrinsic value or market price: whereas halfpence & farthings (like other money) should be made of a metall whose 
        price among Merchants is known, & should be coined as neare as can 
        be to that price including the charge of coynage. And that the people are not nice & curious in taking good copper 
        money, but may be imposed upon by money made of Princes 
        metal instead of the metal here proposed: & that the cutting a 
        pound weight into 32 pence may be a great temptation to counterfeit such money All which reasons incline us to prefer a coynage of good 
        copper according to the intrinsic value of the metal. But we most

664,665.,Reply to his query about the permissible level of wastage in melting.,"28 January 1713., c. 722 words",http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/MINT00452,NA,722 words,28 January 1713.,NA,English,MINT00452,Reply to his query about the permissible level of wastage in melting.,"I have been long indebted to you for your Letters & was in good hopes that the Question you wrote to me about would have been decided without me. But understanding that it is still{our} depending, I here send you my thoughts about it. I  imploy a Melter to melt all the gold & silver coyned & allow him thirteen pence per pound weight  Troy for melting the gold: whereof I reccon at least 3d for potts & fire, & the other 10d for wast & charges of making up the sweep. Whence the wast doth not amount to five grains in the pound of gold. And the wast in silver cannot be much more. Because I do not make up the sweep my self I  cannot speak of this matter by my own experience. But consulting my Melter about it, he told me that the wast in melting was about 6 grains per pound weight of silver, but in refining it was about double to that in melting. And afterwards he told me that in one parcel he had found the wast in melting amount to 14 grains per pound weight. But this  I suspect was by some accident,   For the Goldsmiths reccon the wast so little that they have perswaded the Crown to make no allowance for it in making the money in our Mint, whereas in your Mint the Master is allowed to put  twelve grains of Copper into every pound  weight of silver when the silver is molten & they are pouring it off into the moulds, & this is done to make amends for the wast of the copper which fumes away in the  melting,  In the year  1707 when  the money current in Scotland was to be recoined,  we  wrote to the Officers of your Mint that we were not allowed to put any copper into the pot for making recompence for the wast of copper  which fumed away in the melting, & that they were to conform themselves to the practise of our mint. But they replied that by the flaming coales which they used in melting, a greater wast was caused then in our Mint,  so that unless they were still allowed to put the 12 grains of copper into the pot, they could not coin the money standard. Whereupon this allowance was connived at. How much the copper fumes away in your meltings by the flaming of the coals I do not know: but I reccon that when the allowance of 12 grains per pound weight was instituted, it was deemed a sufficient recompence for the wast made by fuming away: whereas in our Mint as I said we have no  allowance made for recompencing that wast. And thence I gather than the wast in your Mint after making up the sweep ought to be less by some grains then the wast in our Mint : & that the wast upon the whole coinage (if the sweep be well made up) must be under 234 pounds weight & may be so little as not to exceed 125 pounds weight For whilst 12 grains of copper are added to every pound weight of silver in every melting & a pound weight of silver makes but about half a pound weight of money: there are about 24 grains of copper added to  every pound weight of money  coined. And this addition diminishes the whole wast, & should make it 24 grains per pound weight less in your mint then in ours, supposing the coals  <181v>  by the fuming away of the metal {illeg} alike in both mints * < insertion from lower down > *I mean that the 24 grains are more then enough to make good all your wast. < text from f 181v resumes >  And the wast by the flaming coals  be in your Mint should 24 grains per pound weight more then in ours to make the  whole wast which remains after making up the sweep, equal in both Mints.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference upon the Petition of Iohn Pery & other for supplying the Mint with either Blancks or Plates of fine copper to be coined into half pence & farthings, We humbly represent that copper money is at present very little wanted, but if it shall be thought fit to put the coinage of such money into a standing method, We are humbly of opinion That the whole coinage including the making of the blancks be done in the Mint it being unsafe to have coining tools & coinage abroad. That it be done of the cheapest fine copper which will hammer when red hot & is worth about 11d or 12d per pound weight. In finer & dearer copper we may be easily deceived, there being no certain test of the higher degrees of fineness; & the great price will tempt fals coiners to counterfeit the money. That it be done out of copper either hammered into plates at the copper mills, or cast into barrs at the Mint with an addition of two or three ounces of Tinn to an hundred weight of copper in fusion to make the metal run close. Both ways may be tried, but The last way is most conformable to the coinage of gold & silver, & is cheapest by two pence in the pound weight, & seems therefore to be preferred. For there will be at least got by counterfeiting that money whose workmanship is cheapest. That this money have a fair & bold impression & such an edging as may be fittest to prevent counterfeiting it by casting  & {wit}h the stamp  shall be directed by the Queen & council That an Importer be appointed to buy & import the copper by weight, & receive back the new money by weight & tale & put the same away. And that the Master & Worker for the time being, be charged & discharged by his Note as in the coinage of gold & silver & have power to refuse the Copper whenever  upon the Assay it proves not good. That all the charges of Copper; coining tools, coinage, wages & incidents be paid out of the profits of the coinage & that either the Importer or the Master be accountant, & that there be no perpetual salaries to increase the extrinsic value of the moneys, but all services be paid for by the pound weight. That a coinage of about twenty or thirty tunns once in three or four years, or of fifty Tunns once in six or eight years is sufficient for supplying the daily loss & wast of the moneys already coined, & may prove too much if the counterfeiting of the money encreases. And that a coinage of twenty or thirty or at the most fifty Tunns seems to be abundantly sufficient at present. That a coinage of such money may be performed from time to time by one & the same standing Commission & that it be left in the power of the Lord High Treasurer to appoint by a particular Warrant the quantity of copper money to be coined at any time which quantity should never be so great at once as to endanger any clamour. And that when the coinage of such money shall be resolved upon by her Majesty, the Petitioners & others who have copper works be treated with, & his copper chosen which is best coloured & most malleable & cheapest of those sorts of copper which will hammer when red hot. All which, & whether a coinage shall be set on foot till there be a greater want of such money, is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome."

But when I consider the different wayes of Melting here and with you I still think that in all Events the Melter here must suffer a greater loss, and therefor beg leave to lay before you the Circumstances upon which my Iugeing in this matter is founded. The allowance of putting copper into the Pot whilst the standart Silver is melting is not given by connivance as a favour to the Melter, but out= of necessity, because of the violent heat of our Coall, and that without such a practice it would be next to impossible to bring out the Silver at due Standart, And see=ing the Melter in the Towr who has not that difficulty suffers also a loss from 6 to 10 grains per pound and sometymes higher it seems rationall to me that the melting here will  occasion a greater loss, for the Melter here undergoes the common loss with those that Melt with a moderat equall heat, and likewise the loss in the pots refyneing and as the loss in refyneing, even by the practice in the Towr, is reckoned double what Occurs in comon melting, So I conclude that in the melting here, the waste may be reckoned double what is in the Towr for in Effect the melting with our comon coall is almost Equivalent to refyneing. I shall suppose 300 weight Stan=dart Silver put into a pott, immediately upon melting 13 thereof is taken out and cast into the Moulds, but before that can be done, the remaining Silver is Overfined  and needs an addition of Copper to reduce it to standart, and before the 2d part can be cast into the Moulds the remaining 3d part is again Overfyned and must be reduced by addition of allow, so in every pott the Silver is twice refyned which in my Opinion will Occasion in a Supervenient waste above that of Ordi=nary melting: The practice of proportioning alloy to a pot of standart Silver whilst it is melting and casting into the Moulds has been adjusted by long Experience  and is understood but by very few and is so nice that if the workpeople do not  dispatch the pott in due tyme, the Moulds prove above Standart and must be remelted which often happened, and frequently the fire and heat proved  <188v> unexpectedly violent that the alloy could not be proportioned, and were necessitat to take of the pot and clean it and begin anew, and seing the allowance of 125 pound weight for wast mentioned  in your letter is upon supposition of Ordinary Equall melting for the whole Coynage, there must necessarly be an additional Wast for the forsd reasons, there being also a large quantity necessarly refined upwards of 12000 weight for which Mr Allardes got a Considerable Sume allowed him by the public. As to what the London Goldsmiths have suggested about the Waste being so incon=siderable as not to deserve an allowance from the Government I'm perswaded has been malicioūs for our Goldsmiths of Knowledge and reputation are of another Opinion. Mr Allardes and my brother did treat with the best of them and frankly offered 4d per pound weight for bearing the waste which was more then allowed to the Melter in the Towr but none of them would undertake it but at a greater allowance, so that I still think the Account I made up from the Mint books agreeing to the abbreviat thereof given in by my Brother ought not to be quarelled by Mr Allardes friends by which although the work was so much hasted the Waste appears to be considerably less then of any Coynage ever we had formerly, I would therefor humbly beg you againe to consider the  Account and the reason presently Suggested and give me your advice in the matter. I told you in my former that it appears from my Brothers paper that he bought in Bullion which he did not carry into the Books and its known he designed to have provided as much as would pay of the Bank how soon the Mint should be opened, And if Mr Allardes friends shall disallow so great a part of the waste as he now contraverts my brothers Children will suffer a loss far  beyond any benefit he had by serving Mr Allardes in that matter For his Sallary was Sixteen pound 13//4d per ann when there was Coynage and the late Recoynage continued only about two years besides this he had no other benefite except a complement at Mr Allardes death for the Service in the first Melting from the Bank for which Mr Allardes had a full allowance given him out of the Equivalent that melting being no part of his duty as Master. Sir I am doing in this for a widow and four infants which emboldens me so far to trouble you, had Mr Allardes himself been alive I should have had no difficulty for he knew very well what Service my brother did him in that matter and would never have done any thing wherby probably there might arise any loss to my brothers family.

The Memorialist saith that the Queens Assaymaster is a cheque upon the Officers of the Mint,  not knowing that  on the contrary the Comptroller is a cheque upon the whole Mint & all the  three first Officers of the Mint are a cheque upon the Queens Assaymaster. For he preforms his assays by their trial pieces & in their presence & without their approbation his assays are of no force.  In overseeing his Assays the Warden & Comptroller act in behalf of the Queen & her people & the Master acts for himself. And the Assaymaster is to act with skill & sincerity to the satisfaction of the Officers of  both parties. For its easy for an Assayer to give a turn to the assay of a quarter of a grain or an halfpenny weight or above for or against the Master. And if any such thing be suspected the Assayer must repeat his Assay till the Officers of the Mint  are satisfied of his  acting with skill & candor. 2. It was right therefore for the Lord High Treasurer to referr the four Petitioners to a trial before the Officers of the Mint as the proper judges of their qualifications in point of skill.   The Memorialist saith that the Mr Brattle being under the direction of the Officers of the Mint hath acted partially. But this is   to find fault with the very constitution of the Mint. 
        ✝ < insertion from f 98v > ✝ For the Master by the Indenture of the Mint is authorized to receive the bullion by his own assays & for that end is allowed a triall piece & an Assaymaster of his own & all the assays of the bullion imported are the Masters assays  & the assayer in making them acts as his Deputy & is {under his direction}. And as its the Masters duty {&} interest to coin the money by his own trial piece as exactly as he can so he hath given Mr Cha Brattel no  directions to the contrary, nor any other directions than those by which the money has been coyned during the last two years of Mr Daniel Brattels life, & for which the Master has been acquitted by a Iury, the money coined by those directions being found exactly  standard & that Trial piece. And now after the the trial of the Pix upon entring upon a new coinage  he has ordered the first parcel of money to be assayed by the Trial piece  to see if any thing can be mended. < text from f 98r resumes >  But if  the Importer at any time think himself aggrieved by the Masters assays, he hath an Appeal to  the Wardens triel piece And without an appeal Mr Oadham himself if he were the  Queens Assayer would not be able to remedy the pretended grievance. For the Queens Assayer hath nothing to do between the Master & the Merchant  by vertue of his Office unless in cases of appeal. To err within the remedy is no crime but only creates a recconing. If the money upon the trial be found too coarse it may put the Master in debt to her Majesty & if it be  afterwards found too fine  her Majesty allowss the excess of fineness back to the Master in discharge of that   There is no crime in the case but only a recconing founded upon a contract between the Queen & the Master.  If the Master should err by design  the only punishment before the trial of the Pix is that he be at the charge of recoining the money before delivery; but if he errs without design he is not obliged to be at that charge unless the error exceed the remedy.  If he gets by that error he is obliged upo the triall of the Pix to refund his profit, if he loses by it the Crown returns his loss. Nor where the Question is only about a recconing, where the Importer  makes no appeal, where the Warden & Comptroller who are cheque upon the Master in behalf of the Queen & her people find no fault, where the Iury has acquitted the Master: he ought not to be molested  by Mr Oadham or his friends who have nothing to do with the Mint. 3 When Mr Oadham had a trial  before the Officers of the Mint, some of his Assays taken from one & the same piece of Gold differed from others a quarter of a grain & one of them erred two grains which is  three times the Remedy. Whereas all Mr Brattles Assays agreed perfectly with one another except one which differed from the rest only about the twelft part of a grain which is but the eighth part of  the Remedy. And almost all the coinage is in gold. 4 Mr Oadham was offered a longer trial  did not then desire it but has since desired another trial. Had he acknowledged the fairness of the first trial,  & that he had since been learning to assay better & was now grown more skilfull then before,   his request might have been granted  without a reflexion upon the Mint: but he pretends to have learnt his skill long ago  in his Apprenticeship, & has appealed from the Report of the Officers of the Mint.  And now in opposition to that Report produces 
   
         <99r> 
        
        certificate of his skill in assaying signed by Merchants & Goldsmiths but which if well considered destroys it self.   Few of his subscribers have any business with the Mint, & it doth not appear that any of the  are men of note for skill in assaying, or ever met together to see him make a competent number of  successive Assays whereby they might be able to judge of his skill. The Importers are  proper judges not of the skill of an Assayer but of his credit or whether they will freely trust him with their bullion. Amongst his subscribers there are only six who have imported gold within these three years &  all of them together have imported only to the value of about 14 thousand pounds: whereas the Importers who have signed a Certificate or Petition for Mr Brattle (as I am credibly informed, for I have not seen it) have imported to the value of 8 or 9 hundered thousand pounds within that time. All the Importers trust Mr Brattle freely  with their bullion,  but Mr Oadhams credit is not yet established among them. And the credit of the Mint for encouraging the coinage  depends in some measure upon the credit which the Assay master hath with the Importers. 5 The Memorialist suggests that Mr. Brattle being under the directions of th{e} Officers of the Mint, hath acted partially,  Mr Oadham   above a year ago was projecting to be made supervisor & is {still} so fond of supervising  & checking the Officers & getting the   valuation of the bullions & moneys into his power that he is  attempting to throw out the present Officers  rather then not succeed. But the Officers have the Verdict of a Iury on their side. The assays of th{e} money & the trial piece of K. Iames  agreed exactly at the ballance.  What directions have been given by the Officers the Lord High Treasurer has been told by the Master. Those directions were followed by the Queens late Assaymaster two years together before his death, & were no other then to coin by the trial piece of King Iames.  The  Queens Assaymaster has no trial piece of his own but by the constitution of the Mint is bound to follow the directions of the Officers in Assaying by their trial pieces.  To err within the remedy is no crime; it only creates a recconing between the Queen & the Master so far as the Master may have got or lost by the error, & if the error be under a quarter of a grain it uses to be neglected & creates not so much as a recconing.  And after the money hath been found right by a Iury, the Officers have a legal right to be quiet & ought not to be molested by  Mr Oadham or his friends. 6 The Memorialist commends Mr Oadham for  being skilled in the Refiners art. Why then did he not set up of his trade? What made him turn projector.   The Memorialist saith further that Mr Oadham is well skilled  in the business of the Mint & may be very service able upon the greatest occasions. Which makes it suspicious that he designes not to be content with the Assaymasters business but is alredy projecting to make that Post a step to something higher.  Refining & assaying are manual trades & such trades are never closely followed by Projectors. At  his {illeg}{ub}y projecting humour made him leave his Refiners trade so it will never suffer him to stay long in that of an  Assayer. nor to act quietly diligently & steadily while he is in it. The Memorialist saith further that the statute of 2 H. 6, c. 12, which saith that the Assaymaster ought to be a person indifferent between the Master of the Mint & the Merchant is in Mr Oadham's favour. And yet Mr Oadham  hath the approbation of neither part   but sets himself against the Officers of the Mint & endeavours to get the place by an interest forreign to both parties. By that statute if any question should arise about the valuation of bullion which cannot be decided without the Queens Assaymaster the  coynage must stop till there be an Assaymaster. 8. The Officers of the Mint have given their opinion in this matter & leave it entirely to her Majesty to put in what Assaymaster she thinks fit."

August 1713.,NA,English,MINT00086,Further holograph draft on the examinations of Oadham and Brattell.,"Mr Oadhams paper of reasons against Mr Brattel is full of mistakes. Sir Isaac Newton was the first man who proposed a trial between the Petitioners & never opposed or discouraged it or affirmed that Mr Brattel could not do the business of an Assaymaster without an Assistant, nor know of any hardships or impositions in the trial between them, nor of any Reference of Mr Oadhams Petition from the King to the Treasury, nor is the place of Assaymaster in the  gift of the Lords of the Treasury but in that of his Majesty who hath given it to Mr Brattel, &  The Act of 2 H. 6 doth not void the grant, nor exclude the Mint Master  from joyning with his fellow Officers in recommending an Assaymaster.  To recommend a good one is as much his Duty as any mans & much more his interest & concern because he  can make no advantage by bad assays but may be ruined by them . And therefore his recommendation is more to be regarded in point of impartiality then that of any other subject whatsoever. Mr Oadham pretends that Mr Brattels incapacity & unfairness can be proved.  Whereas upon the Trial between them, seven of Mr Brattels eight Assays of Gold agreed with one another without any sensible difference & the eighth differed from the rest only the twelft part of a grain: whilst some of Mr Oadham's gold Assays differed a quarter of a grain from others  & one of them erred two grains which is  24 times more then the greatest error of Mr Brattel: & Mr Brattel was also observed to heat with more dexterity & dispatch then Mr Oadham. And as for their  other qualifications  it was then thought unadvisable to  to reject a person who with his brother had kept up & improved the credit of the Mint upon a person who in his Apprentisship had neglected his Masters business to mind Projects & when his time was out left his trade to buy & sell stocks, & was suspected to have sent  to Mr Brattel an Offer of the place for a summ of money, which suspicion has been  increased by a  report of  his talking lately to the same purpose, not to mention his carriage to the Officers of the Min in such a manner as is not to be born in an Assaymaster."

August 1713.,NA,English,MINT00085,'The state of the Mint in relation to the Queens Assay Master'.,"The state of the Mint in relation to the Queens AssayMaster.  The Warden & Comptroller are a cheque upon the Master in behalf of the Queen & her people & the Master has covenanted with her Majesty that they shall assist him in seeing that the coynage be well performed. And if either of them dies the  rest of the Officers go on with the coynage & a new Officer is  appointed with convenient speed. And if the Master dies the rest go on to coin & deliver what he has received {illeg} & a new Master is appointed with convenient speed & empoured by a signe mannual to  receive new bullion untill an indenture can be prepared. For it has been a Maxim in the Mint ever since I remember, that the Mint never stands still. The Queens Assaymaster is no cheque upon the Officers of the Mint but they are a cheque upon him. For he has no Trial piece of his own but performs his assays by the Wardens trial piece i nthe presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller who are to see that his Assays be done with skill & fidelity.  The Warden & Comptroller are present in behalf of the Queen & her people & the Master in his own behalf & the Assaymaster is only a manual Operator & by Act of Parliament ought to be an indifferent person between both parties, & to attend weekly for determining all controversies which may arise between the Merchants & the Master about the valuation of the Bullion imported. He is also to try the new mony before delivery in the presence of the said officers. And this is all the     duty imposed on him by the  Crown. The Master receives the Merchants bullion by his own Assays made by his own Trial piece & is allowed 60l per annum for an Assayer. But  it is long since grown into custome for the Master to trust the Queens Assaymaster. And this seems to have been done partly  because 7-li is too little to maintain a  responsible creditable Assayer, & partly for avoiding dispute with the Merchant who may reccon the Assays of the Queens Assayer more satisfactory. Since the last trial of the  Pix there has not been any dispute between the Merchant & the Master. They all acquiesce in his Assays, & are allowed & desired to see  the Assays as often as they please. But if any Merchant should complain & demand a {legal} trial by the Queens sworn Assaymaster, the  receipt of Bullion  for feat of undue preference must stop till the assay be performed.  So then it was very proper for the Lord High Treasurer  to refer to the Officers of her Majestys Mint the examination  or trial of the candidates for the Assaymasters place,  they being legal judges of the truth & fidelity of all his assays & the approbation of both parties  between whom he is to be an indifferent person, being included in their Report. 
 <91v>  When Mr Brattel & Mr Oadham had a comparative Trial. Report of the Officers. The Warden & Comptroller are cheques upon the Master  & all three are cheques upon the Queens Assaymaster.  And this Assaymaster is only a manual operator who  is to perform all his Assays in the presence of the  said three Officers with skill & fidelity, they being judges thereof, the Warden & Comptroller in behalf of the Queen & her people  & the Master in his own behalf And therefore it was very right in the Lord High Treasurer to refer the Petitioners for the Assaymasters place to a trial before the said Officers & their report  is the joynt report of both parties between whom the Assaymaster is to act as an indifferent person. For by the statute of   Hen VI c    he ought to be an indifferent person betwen the Master & the Merchants & to attend weekly for dedicing all controversies between them about the valuation of their bullion. But no such controversies have  arisen since the death of the late Assaymaster, the Merchants being satisfied with the Masters Assays, & being allowed & invited to see them himself whenever he pleases. By which means his credit of the Mint at present is very good. And for preserving the same & thereby encouraging the  coinage & avoyding  the trouble of controversies with Importers its the interest as well as the duty of the Officers of the Mint to give their opinion faithfully in favour of the  best  Assayers.

For he has no Trial piece of his own, but performs his Assays by their Trialpieces and in theire presence, and his Assays without their approbation are of no force. In overseeing his assays the Warden and Comptroller act in behalf of the Queen and her people and the Master acts for himself, and the Assaymaster acts only as a manual Artificer, and is to act with sill and sincerity to the satisfaction of the officers of both parties. For it's easy for an Assayor to give a Turn to the assay of a quarter of a Grain, or an half penny weight or above for or against the Master. And if any such thing be suspected, the Assayer must Repeat his Assay, till the officers of the Mint are satisfied of his acting with skill and Candour. It was very right therefore for the Lord high Treasurer to Referr all the petitioners to a Trial before the officers of the Mint as the proper Iudge of their Qualifications in point of skill. When Mr. Brattell and Mr. Oadham had a Comparative Trial before the officers they made each of them Eight Assays of Gold in four successive Fires, two in {artiffice}, and as many of silver. Some of Mr. Oadham's Assays taken from one and the same peice of Gold differ'd from others a Quarter of a Grain, and one of them Erred two Grains which is three times the Remedy, and the Error was in finess, and therefore not likely to be by mere accident; whereas all Mr. Brattell's Gold Assays agreed perfectly with one another, except one which differ'd from the rest only about the twelfth part of Grain, which is but the Eighth part of the Remedy: and almost all the Coynage is in Gold. Mr. Brattel was also observed to handle things with more Dexterity and dispatch. At that time Mr. Oadham was offerd a further Trial by more Assays, and did not then desire it, but has since desired another Trial. Had he acknowledged the fairness of that Trial, and that h e had since been Learning to Assay better and was now grown more skilful than before, his Request might have been ranted without a Reflection upon the Mint. But he pretends to have learnt his skill long ago in his Apprenticeship, and has appeald from the Report of the Officers. If declining a Trial be an objection against some of the petitioners, appealing from the Report of the officers and endeavouring to Carry his point by detaining them and making an interest against them, is a greater objection against Mr. Oadham. For The increase of the Coyn depends upon the credit of the Mint with Importers, and this Credit is at present very good and its the Interest of the Government to support it, and the Masters Interest to improve it. To say that Mr Brattle being under the direction of the officers of the Mint hath acted partially, is to Complain of the very Constitution of the Mint, for the Queens Assaymaster ought to be as much under the direction of the Officers of the Mint in assaying of the money as Mr. Brattel is at present. And the directions given here,, were not other than those given to his Brother the Queens late assaymaster two years before dis death, and they have been Executed more exactly by him than by his Brother, and they were to Act by the Trial peice of King Iames. The pott assay pieces of the Gold coyned after the Trial of the piz 1710: until those directions were given being melted down together and assayed in the Mint were found to agree with that Trial piece Exactly, the Ballance standing at the Cock: And all the Gold money coyned since that Trial of the pix, being lately tried by the same Trial piece the Iury found them equal in Finess, the Ballance standing at the cock: and after the money hath been found well Coin'd by a Iury, the Master of the Mint hath a legal Right to be quiet against the Queens subjects for what is past By the standing Constitution of the Mint the Master and Worker receives and Coyns all the Bullion of Gold and silver by his own Trial piece, the Importer hath at all times an Appeal from the Masters Assays, to the Warden's Trial pieces, and the Queen and all her people have an Appeal to the Trial piece of the Exchequer at every Trial of the pix. If any Importer is dissatisfied with the Masters Assays and will appeal to a Triall by the wardens Trial piece, the Queen and council or the Lord High Treasurer may appoint any different person or persons skilled in Assaying to stand by and see the whole Trial. But if the Importers do not Complain, Mr. Oadham and his Friends who are not Importers, have no right to Appeal, Complain or intermeddle with the Mint. They and all the Queens subjects will have justice done them at the next Trial of the pix: and in the mean time they are not to discourage the Importation of Bullion into her Majesties Mint."

By the Act of 18 Car. 2. and a subsequent Act of the 4th. of Q. Anne, Entituled An Act for encouragement of Coynage, the sallarys of the Officers of the Mint, and the charges towards providing, maintaining, & repairing of the houses, Offices, and buildings, and other necessaries for assaying, melting down and coyning are limited to 3500li. to prevent extravagancys and the overplus of the money arising  by those Acts  is appropriated for and towards the expence, wast and charge opf Assaying, melting down and Coynage &c. The necessarys in the first part of the clause are called the charge & expence of the Mint; and the Overplus is called the charge or expence of Assaying, melting down & Coyning. By the first are understood such necessaries for coyning as may be limited without discouraging the coynage; or such necessaries as are requisite to keep up a standing Mint wither there is any coynage or no; is being to be supposed that the Mint is always ready fitted up, when any coynage {ofters}. By the 2d. part of the Clause are understood the necessaries that cannot be limitted without danger of discouraging the coynage, that is to say such as are occasioned by a coynage and increase or decrease therewith. The Act of Parliament reckons the houses, offices & buildings amongst the necessaries, and the Indenture of the Mint made upon that foot, settling the sallaries of each respective officer leaves only £400. for the buildings, diet, and other necessary provisions whereby the master may be enabled to carry on the Coynage. By the Indenture of the Mint ( is a contract between the Crown and the Master & Worker) some Officers of the Mint act in behalf of the Crown as checks upon the Master, to see that he performes his contract duly and endeavours that the money be well coyned, and others act under him for performing that contract. By this Indenture the Warden pays the sallaries of the former as also the charges of the dyet, and other necessarys employed in and about the repairing the houses offices & buildings that are requisite to carry on that service. These are the necessarys within the 3500li. per annum. Out of the overplus are defrayed the charges of coyning the Gold and silver monys, I mean the allowances made by Indenture of 6s 6d per pound weight for Gold, and 17s. 12 per pound weight for silver monies as also the wooden work of the Mills, presses & cutters and the nealing and blanching furnaces and the furnaces in the Melting houses which are always repaired by the direction of the master and the charges thereof placed to his account according to the course of the Mint: as are also the charges of Assaying (viz charcoale aqua fortis, water silver, lead, cuppells, furnaces &c) and those of reducing the Gold and Silver to standard by refining and allay. those  of Assaying by virtue of the Clause in the Coynage acts and those of refining by a Clause in the Indenture. These charges are placed in the master's account according to the course of the Mint, while the charges of repairing the buildings are placed in the Wardens account; and the reason{s} of this distinction seems to be that the master may be enabled to dispatch the coynage & make delivery with all convenient speed according to is covenants without staying for the consent or order of the other Officers or being restricted by the want of money, while the sallaries of the officers and the charges of providing & repairing the buildings and other necessaries in the Warden's {account} are limited to £3000 for preventing extravagance."

And these necessaries, in the clause preceding, are called the charge or expence of the Mint, & the overplus is called the charge or expence of Assaying melting down & coyning & the encouragement of bringing in bullion to coyne. By the first I understand such necessaryes for coining as may be limited without discouraging the coynage: by the second such as cannot be limited without danger of discouraging it, that is, such as are occasioned by a coynage & increase or decrease therewith. The Art of Parliament reckons the Houses Offices & Buildings among the necessaries, & the Indenture of the Mint made at that time adds the Diet of the Officers & allows 2600£ per annum for the salaries & leaves only 400£ for the buildings Diet & other necessaries or necessary provisions whereby the Master may be enabled to carry on the coynage. Vpon the contract by Indenture between the Crown & the Master & Worker for the time being, some Officers of the Mint act in behalf of the Crown as cheques upon the Master to see that he performs his contract duely, & endeavour that the Money be well coyned, & others act under him for performing that contract. And by this Indenture the Warden pays the Salaries of the former & the charges of the Diet of the Officers, & other necessary charges to be employed in & about the making of the moneys & repairing of the Offices & Houses necessary to be employed in the said service These are the necessaries within the 3000£. And the Master out of the Overplus pays the Moneyers 9d12 per pound weight of silver & 3s. 6d per pound weight of Gold for drawing cutting flatting sizing marking & coyning the same & for all their labour, wast, & expence therein, & for keeping in repair all the Rollers & Instruments to cut flatten make round & size the pieces & mark them on the edges, & all other Tools Engins & Instruments amongst which are the Mills & Presses & the Scales weights vices & files for sizing the pieces. But the wooden worke of the Mills Presses & Cutters & the Nealing & blanching furnaces, & the furnaces in the melting houses are repaired by the direction of the Master & Worker & the charges thereof are placed in his account according to the course of the Mint. & so are all the charges of Assaying (vizt. in Char-coal, Aqua fortis, water silver, Lead, Cuppels, Furnaces &c) & those of reducing the Gold & Silver to standard by refining & allay. All these charges are paid by the Master out of the surplus above the three thousand pounds, vizt. the charges of repairing the Iron work of the Mills, Presses, Flatters & other coining tools & those of reducing the Bullion to standard are so paid by vertue of certain clauses of the Indenture, & those of Assaying by vertue of a clause of the coynage Act. The wooden work of the Mills, Presses & Flatters relate to the coining Tools. The Assay furnace is a moveable engine made of copper plates. The other
    
     <334v> 
    
    furnaces are distinguished from the buildings in being under the Masters direction. He erects repairs removes & rebuilds them without medling with the buildings or asking the consent or leave of the other Officers & he places the charge of repairing them in his own Account according to the course of the Mint, while the charge of repairing the buildings are placed in the wardens Account. And the reason of this distinction seems to be that the Master may be enabled to dispatch the coynage & make delivery with all convenient speed according to his covenants without staying for the consent or Order of the other Officers or being retarded by the want of money, while the Salaries of the Officers & the charges of providing & repairing the buildings & other necessaries in the wardens Accompt are limited to 3000£. for preventing extravagance. And by this means the Warden & Master are enabled to make up their Accounts severally without depending upon one another. If any doubt arise about the force of the custome or course of the Mint, this course (not being contrary to a higher Law) is made a Law by the following clause of the Indenture of the Mint. And that the said Master & Worker shall upon his Accompt yearly to be made of his Receipts, Payments, Charges & disbursements before the Auditors of the Mint or Mints for the time being have full allowance defalcation & discharge of & for all such sum & sums of money as he shall duly pay & disburse according to the true intent & meaning of the above recited Letters Patents & according to the directions hereafter in these presents expressed & according to the course of the said Mint or Mints respectively, as by the same Acts of Parliament is directed & appointed. The last words relate to the words of the coynage Act, That the moneys shall be issued out of the Office of Receipt of the Mint from time to time according to the manner & course of the said Mint. The Master & Worker also as Treasurers of the Mint pays the fees at the Exchequer & Treasury upon receiving the coynage money, & those for passing the Accounts through the severall Offices of the Exchequer. He pays also the charges of trying the Pix, & the fees for summoning the Iury & entrying the Veredict. The Pix is tryed by the Assay & the charges thereof belong to that head. But the charge of a Dinner for the Iury being too great to come within the 3000£. hath been hitherto paid out of the civil List. The particulars of the Master & Workers Accompt for the year 1712 are as follow{s} The gold furnaces were necessary to be repaired for carrying on the coynage & the charges thereof & those of Assaying & reducing the bullion to standard were free from extravagance & just & unavoidable & the fees of the Exchequer & Treasury & other Offices were customary & necessary to be paid, & all these expences are placed in my accompt according to the course of the Mint & the Vouchers are good. And therefore all these charges are I think to be allowed at present by the article of the Indenture above recited. And the Warden is to discharge himself of what has been imprest to him, & in his next Accompt to charge himself with the surplus, if any there be. The Salary of 40£ to the Wardens second Clerk is now ceased but in its stead the charges of the dinner of the Iury at the last trial of the Pix (amounting to about 92£ will come into the next years accompt."

They that Work Copper from the oar when they have brought it to such a degree as they call fine Copper, sell it to those who have Mills for manufacturing it and expose it to sale in their Warehouses in London And such Copper is  worth from 95li. to 100li. per Tun and very little of it is worth above 100li per Tun. This is commonly called fine Copper. But that of 95li per Tun will scarce hammer without flying in pieces, that of 100li. per Tun will scarce hammer without cracking. They refine it at the Copper Mills till it will hammer without cracking and then it is worth 1112 per pound Weight or about 107li. per Tun or thereabouts + < insertion from lower down f 413r > +Refiners of Copper by refining a small part of any mass can  make an Estimate of the charge of refineing the whole mass and how much fine Copper it will produce But the best way of makeing such an Assay is not yet agreed upon when it shall be agreed upon and brought into Common use it may be then considered  whether the Master and Worker shall be allowed to buy Course Copper by such an assay and put it out to refine with publick money and what he shall be allowed in his Accounts for the refinening thereof according to teh severall degrees of the Courseness, & what for the wast by evaporations. In the mean time the Master or any other person may buy Course Copper, put it out to be  refined and send it to the Mints to be Coyned. < text from f 413r resumes >  The Malleability of the Copper depends not only on the fineness of the Metal or freedom from other metals but also upon the manner of  refining it, for if it be refined with seacoale it will not be Malleable and fitt for working though it be fine. It may be refined with sea coale till it begins to be fine, and then it must be wrought with charred coal till it be fully fine & the charred Coale of wood is better then seacoal charred: Also the melting diminishes the Malleability, especially if it be melted with too much heat.  And for those reasons the assay by the hammer is the best and surest for the Mints. If it shall be thought fitt that Copper money be made of such Copper as in hammering when red hott will crack but not fly in pieces, it may be bought at the Copper Warehouses in London; If of such Copper as will hammer (red hott) without Cracking it must be had of those who refine Copper. In the Reign of King Charles the second a pound weight of Swedish Copper was cut into 20  d; The Copper and makeing the blanks cost 18d. the stamping a penny & a penny remained for other charges; This Copper was  malleable so as to hammer red hott without Cracking. If it be thought fit that the Money now to be Coyned by of like fineness  so as to endure the same test, the Copper will cost 11 12 per pound Weight as  above and the Coynage about 6d. or 6d.14 without edging or 7d with edging And if a pound weight not edged be cut into 20d. or a pound weight edged by cutt into 21d. there will be an excess of 2d12 per pound weight for purchasing Mills & presses & cutters and flatters & setting up a Copper Mint, and paying Clerks and incident charges of Assaying, weighing, telling, Porterage, baggs, paper & packthread, outting off &c. But if it be thought that the Copper be onely so fine as to endure the  hammer when red hott without flying in pieces tho not without cracking a pound weight may be cut into 19d. not edged or 20d edged. The Mills and presses and other engines  for setting up a Copper Mint will cost six or seven hundred pounds & three farthings per pound weight in Coyning an hundred Tunns will pay that charge. And when that charge is paid the weight of the money may be little augmented. If the blanks be so thick or the impression use so high as to strain the Dies or Cutters and make them more apt for break then in the Coynage of Gold and Silver or the casting into barrs prove so difficult as to make above one half of the Barrs become scissell the charge of Coynage must be proportionally augmented for which reasons the charges of Coynage cannot be positively sett without experience in Coyning some Tunns of Copper Money. The weight of all the Copper received and the weight and Tale of all the Copper money oyned may be entered into Books & in the accounts of the  Master and worker & the surplus above all charges may be paid into the  Exchequer. all which is most humbly submit{ted} to your Lordship's great Wisdom 22d.

If any gold be brought in which is not tough, he returns it back to be toughned at the Importers charge tho it be standard. If any gold or silver be not eavenly mixed he returns it back to be remelted at the Importers charge. If it be not neare to standard he returns it back to be refined at the Importers charge. And to judg whether it be fit to be received or returned back is left to his discretion. And by parity of reason he should not be obliged to receive all sorts of copper to be coyned. If it be not fine or not tough & malleable or ill coloured or otherwise faulty, he should be at liberty to return it back to be made fit for the Mint at the Importers charge. Otherwise it will be difficult & scarce practicable to coyn the money of good malleable copper without allowing for the charge hazzards & loss attending such an undertaking. There is an assay of copper by refining a small parcel & then recconing what will be the wast charges & trouble in refining a Tunn of such copper. And such an assay is usefull in buying  coarse copper to be refined but is of little or no use in buying fine copper, nor proper for the Mint. The price of fine copper depends upon the malleability, & two parcels of  copper equally fine, may differ very much in their malleability & by consequence in their price. Copper refined to that degree & in that manner as to be malleable without cracking when red hot is the fittest material for manufacturing into all sorts of copper vessels & by consequence for money. The Swedish copper money is of this standard; And such copper is usually valued at about 1112d per poundweight. And if it be made still more soft & malleable the wire-drawer may value it at two or three shillings per pound weight because of its fitness for his use. Tis the ductility that makes it usefull & the usefulness that sets a price upon it & the trial by hammering & bending hot & cold that determins the ductility. This is the assay by which Refiners of Copper know when their Copper is fully fine & ready to vitrify & by consequence the proper assay for receiving fine copper into the Mint. For it determins the fineness & the malleability at once, no coarse copper being malleable. By the estimates of Workmen the charges of repairing & fitting up the houses in the Irish Mint for a coynage of copper, will amount to about 146li. And the putting up a furnace in the melting house with all things answerable for making an experiment by casting will cost about 32li more. And a small parcel of copper for making an experiment may cost about 20li more. If your Lordship please to impress 200li to me for this service upon accompt it may be repaid out of the copper coynage All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great Wisdom  Is. Newton"

OObservation 1. In the last coynage of copper money an hundred Tunns per annum in six years made a great complaint in Parliament whereby the coynage was stopt all the seventh year by reason of too great a quantity of copper money, & after the coynage of another hundred Tunns the nation was fully stockt during the next five or six years. Therefore six or seven hundred Tunns is abundantly sufficient to stock the nation & a coynage of 1500 Tunns in five years time is not practicable by reason of the clamours it would make amongst the people. At present there wants not above 80 or 100 Tonns in all. Observation 2. If a pound weight of copper be cut into 20d, a Ton in coyn will amount only unto 186li. 13s. 4d. It must be cut into 22d that a Tonn may make 205li. But its better that it should be coyned nearer to the intrinsic value. Observation 3. Casting, drawing, cutting, flatting, scouring, nealing, blanching drying & coyning cannot be done for 35li per Tonn. And 11li per Tonn for changing the copper money is something too much. In the last coynage of copper money 5d per pound weight was allowed by the Patentees for casting drawing cutting flatting scouring nealing drying & coyning including the work of the Graver & Smith. There was also 40s per Tonn allowed to a Comptroller. And if 7li6s 8d per Tonn be allowed for putting off, the whole charge including the pirce of the copper at 10d per pound weight will amount unto 16d per pound weight. Which deducted from 22d per pound weight leaves a profit of 6d per pound weight. And this profit in coyning 1500 Tonns amounts unto 85000li, out of which something may be abated for housrent clerks coyning tools & incidents. Observation 4. He that assays  sizes & coyns the copper money should  not be impowered to make any profit by coyning it too light or too coarse, & therefore should have nothing to do with buying or providing the copper or distributing it to the people by tale: but should only receive it by weight & assay & deliver it back in money by weight & assay & have it in his power to refuse bad copper.

    To Sir Is. Newton < text from f 390r resumes >  May it please your Lordship  It is a generall complaint that Farthigns and halfe pence are wanted and it is discoursed that a Pattent is grantted to make some I believe it a  concerne worthy the notice of all true Brittish patriotts to consider whether the makeing a small alteration in that sort of coin will not be a very great advantage to the Kingdom     The coin used for all small payments under six pence is Copper farthings and halfe pence and if a six pence be paid in all those single farthings they must certanly be 24 in num{ber} and I believe generaly weigh about 4 ounces h{alf} in the whole six pence    Lett the same quantity of copper then be made into 25 Equall parts which now goe (or is Currant) at six pence (and is divided into 24 farthings) And then a pound sterling with all its lesser denominations of        shillings and farthings may be Expressed (joyntly with those lesser parts) by naturall numbers without useing those different denominations abovementioned and so Expressed in naturall numbers may be used without any Reduction in all the rules of arithmetick wherein it shall be any ways concerned with very great Ease and certanty I presume almost all Europe make use of the same Carrecters to Express number which are used here in Brittain and I think there is noe materiall difference abroad from the rules here given for to learne the four first rules of Vulgar arithmetick & therefore a sett of naturall numbers not denominated to signifie any thing but what those numbers naturally express will be added or subtracted &c by a Brittain or a Forreigner with Equall ease and Certanty and such naturall numbers will our Brittish pound and its parts be best Expressed by if the six pence as above be divided into 25 Equall parts from whence its plain that a Brittish account sent into any Forreign part soe Expressed will be there as easie

In trade there are uncertain secrets & mysteries which cannot be reduced to a recconing, & unlesse competent allowances be made for these, the Dutch will undersell the Queens Agent at Amsterdam The secret method for setting the price now upon the Tynn at Amsterdam is to know the price of the Tynn in the market of Amsterdam at any certain time & the course of exchange at the same time & thence compute the price by the course of the Exchange at this present time. When the  Lord Treasurer Godolphin set the price at 4412 Gilders the price in the market was from 45 to 47 Gilders.  As I find by Mr Drummonds letter, & his Lordship abated 12 a Gilder to make room for the varying of the Exchange. At that time the Exchange was at 34sc. 6d. Tis now at 35sc 10d. And as 34. 6 to 35 10 so is 45 Gilders the lowest price in the market at that time to 46. 15 the lowest price in the market,  suitable to the course of Exchange at this time. And this price answer to 4li 3s 6 per  English weight Late summer when the Exchange came down to 34sc. 0d or under the lowest price of the Tin in the market was 4412G. And at that rate the lowest price ought now to be G. 15st or 47G And these prices answer to 4li 3s. 6 or 4li 4s per  weight english. In the Account lately drawn up by me, the price came to 4li 5s 8d per  English weight.  But to bring it to the lowest price of the market some abatements mest be made. A Dutch Commission for buying Tyn at the Tower was there put at 9d whereas the Dutch can have their business done  by the Pewterers for 6d. Insurance at sea was put at 9d whereas the Dutch in times of peace will not value it at 3d Interest for two months forbearance of payments was put at 9 stivers per 100 weight whereas the Dutch who can borrow money at 4 per cent will reccon it but at 6 stivers per 100 weight. And freight was put at 313 stivers 100wt whereas the Dutch can have Tyn brought home upon their own bottoms sometimes at half that price & sometimes  for ballast If upon all these accounts about 14d be abated the remaining price will be 4. 4. 6 per  weight. And  further, there must be an abatement out of the Duties in Holland which amounted to 1 Gilders 556 stivers per 100 weight. For a Dutchman usually contrives to have his Tin  put on board several ships for lessening the charge of freight, & to run as much of it as he can & what they cannot run they endeavour by their acquaintance to get taxed low. And I know not what  abatement to make for these practises. If  only 6d per  be abated the remaining price will be 4li. 4s. 0d per . If 1s it will be 4li. 3s. 6d.  By all these recconings the lowest price of Tynn per 100 weight in the Dutch Marckets should answer to 4li 3s 6d or 4. 4. 0 per  weight English or thereabouts. For I know not how to be more exact in 
    
     <537v> 
        
        this clippers recconing. Out of this price a deduction is to be made of one per cent Commission, one per cent prompt payment, one per cent insurance of payments if her Majesty insures, 13 per cent Brokerage, 16 per cent carriage to the city weigh house {8} weighing for sale, 12 per cent City Duty at the Weighous{e} 15 per cent warehouse room: In all 415 per cent, or 3s 6d per  weight.  And the remaining price will be 4li. 0s. 0d or 4li. 0s. 6d clear of all charges except  who shall be allowed for returning the money for which the Tynn is sold. For Mr Beranger insisted upon 5d per  for turning specie mo{ney} into Bank money. In the discourses between Mr Beranger & me about this matter he proposed to  sell the Tynn himself by his Agents & make his payments to the Queen as soon as the money came in the {illeg} at the end of two months after the sales,  so much time being given to the chapm{en} to make their prompt payments to him. No mention was made of usan{illeg} for the money was to become due to the Queen at the end of the two months, & I had no notion of her Majestys paying interest for her own money.  Mr Beranger proposed t{o} sell the tynn himself at his Lordps price & pay the produce clear of all charges to {illeg} Lordships Order, or account for the same before an Auditor provided he could have good Vouchers. He proposed to make his payments to {the} Queen within two months after the sales so much time being given to Chapmen to make their prompt payments to him. And no mention was made o{f} {illeg}ance Considering the great quantity of the Tinn & that Mr Beranger does not live in Holland, as Mr Drummond did. An Agent, whenever it shall be thought fit, may be sent into Holland to oversee the sales & Accounts & Tynn remaining & keep a recconing thereof & perhaps have one of the keys to each Warehouse where the Tinn is laid up till it shall begin to be sold out of that warehouse."

The last Contract for Tin commencing Iune 1st 1710, & ending with the Queens death Aug. 1st 1714 for 1800 Tunns per annum from Cornwall in times peace besides about 40 Tuns from Devon. And the consumption has carried off 1180 Tuns annum which is less than the purchase by about 660 Tunns per. And at her Majestys death there remained in her hands unsold about 4800 Tuns standard weight. If the contract be renewed & assigned over to the King, the Queens Tin will be at least four years in selling & at the end of that time the King will have  7360 Tuns  in his hands unsold, & so be in  much worse circumstances as to these Contracts then the Queen was at her death. This Tin will cost the King 510293li, besides freight 7360li, charges in Cornwall  9000 & London about 9000, & interest of all the money advanced at 5 per cent 52665li; in all, 57{77{1}8}li before this Tin begins to be sold. And during the sale thereof the interest of the 579318li at 5 per cent would amount into 28966li per annum. Let us now suppose that at the end of that time the contract ceases & that the price of the Tin is lowered untill the King shall sell as much Tin as shall be sold by the people of Cornwall, suppose 600 Tuns per annum (the whole sales amounting to about 1180 Tuns) & for compassing this, the price must be so low that it shall not be worth the whole for Cornwall to dig & work above 580 or 600 Tuns per annum. When the price has been 55 or 50li per Tun, they have dug a much greater quantity, & therefore the price must be set lower, suppose at 45 or 40li per Tun. Now if the King should sell 600 Tuns per annum after the rate of 45li per Tun standard weight, the sale would produce an Annuity of  27000li per annum till all his Tin be sold, that is, for twelve years & a quarter & this Annuity would not suffice to pay the interest of the 579{3}18li advanced, & in the end of the time there would be not left to satisfy the King for the principall & for the further charges of selling the Tin, & therefore the King may lose above 58000li, by  a contract for only four years. And if he cannot take up money at 5 per cent 
        +
         < insertion from the left margin > +nor sell his tin at 45li per Tunn < text from f 524r resumes > 
        
        his loss may be still greater. And if to lessen the loss he would sell his Tin faster, he must sell it for a price still lower & thereby increase the discontent of Cornwall. Whence its easy to understand that if hte  contract should be renewed for three years only, the King might lose   three or four  hundred thousand pounds  thereby or above, & if it should be renewed for above four years, the loss & dead stock of Tin would encrease perpetually, & make it every year more & more difficult to put an end to these contracts without ruining  the owners of Tin-lands in Cornwall."

Of all the kings of the Medes Cyaxeres was the greatest warrior Herodotus tells us that he was much more warlike then his ancestors & that he was the first who reduced the irregular & undisciplined forces of the Medes into discipline & therefore by the testimony of Herodotu{s} he was that king of the Medes  whom Æschylus  makes the first conqueror & founder of the Empire {illeg} saying {illeg} He that first led the army was a Mede.  Darius according to Daniel was the son of Achsuerus of that seed of  the Medes, that is the son of Cyaxeres of the seed royal. He reigned by the laws of the Medes & Persians (Dan 0.8, 12, 15 & 8.20) & therefore he reigned over the Medes & Persians as well as over Babylon, & the Medes being set first were uppermost in his reign,  for afterwards when the Persians were uppermost they were set before the Medes  Esther 1.3, 14, 18, 19. You may know also by the number of provinces in the kingdom of Darius that he  was king of the Medes & Persians For upon the conquest of Babylon he set over the whole kingdom 120 Princes & afterwards when  Egypt Thebais & Lybica were added by Cambyses the whole continued but 127 Provinces Esther 1. {illeg}. So then  Cyaxeres, Darius & Cyrus were the three first kings mentioned by Æschylus the oldest greek author who writes of these things. Herodotus has incerted the order of the kings Astyages & Cyaxeres, putting  Astyages after Cyaxeres Xenophon has restored the right order & Daniel has added Darius  after them both, a man of the same age with Cyrus the grandson of Astyages.  Astyages did nothing glorious.  In his reign  a great body of Scythians commanded by Madyes – – – – Darius into a very great Monarchy. This Monarchy rose up by the fall of Nineveh & about 69 or 70 years after by the fall of Babylon grew to its full greatness excepting that Cambyses enlarged it into Egypt. The great slaughters which Cyaxeres made of the nations in erecting this Empire of the Medes – – – – – which was about 70 years. It is to be conceived therefore – – – before Cyrus as above. When Cyrus had conquered Babylon – – – committed a mistake in the time & name of the king.  King Iames the 1st to signify that he would unite the two kingdoms of England & Scotland stiled himself Magna Britanniæ Rex & on the Reverse of his broad pieces & xxs pieces  put this Motto Faciam eos in Gentem unam, I will make them one nation Ezek 37. 22. In reference to this inscription & thereby to signify that her Majesty has finished a great & difficult work an undertaking of an 100 years standing I propose the following Medal. On the first side her Majesties effigies with the inscription  ANNA. D. G. MAGNÆ. BRITANNIÆ. F. et. H. REGINA. On the second her Majesty in royal apparel, in the posture of Britannia sitting on a Globe  with a speare in her hand & a shield by her side to represent both her self & her mystical body Britannia. The sheild to be charged with the new arms of great Britain, In her left hand a Rose & a Thistle grow upon one stalk; the Rose towards her right hand.  In the prospect {below} two revers (Tamesis & Boderia) unite into one common stream Over her head two hands to signify that this is the work of heaven come out of the  clouds holding a single crown to crown her,    The motto, FECI. EOS. IN. GENTUM. UNAM. And in the Exergue I. MAII. MD{C}VII. In this designe the union is represented by the single crowns in two hands by the Rose & Thistle upon one stalk, by the new arms of great Britain upon the shield, & by the two Rivers Thames &  Forth uniting: for rivers were anciently the emblemes of Kingdom. By The Motto,  the union is {refered}   to the Queen as  the minister of heaven in this work, & although this motto yet may at first seem flat,  being compared with that on the gold coynes of King Iames I, & with the Prophesy of Ezekiel it will appear very significant  comprehensive,  lively, pious & majestick, & perhaps the most apposite of any that can be thought of. A poetical Motto is not so grave for such an occasion. Two weoman hand in hand to represent England & Scotland united, sum to signify only a federal union, or only such an union as is represent by the Motto on the money of King Charles I, Floreal concordia regna. After3 the union4, England1 & Scotland2 should be remembered no more, & therefore in the Medal they should be only glanced at & nat made too conspicuous. However for variety I have caused two  draughts  of weoman to be made together with two other draughts on the next pages, but prefer that above. The Draughts were made in hast & when the designe in general is resolved upon the Graver will be more exact. How Cyrus dethroned his predecesoor Herodotus tells at large excepting that he errs in the name of the king. Cyaxeres according to Herodotus reigned 40 years & his successor 35 & therefore Astyages the grandfather of Cyrus & father of Cyaxeres was dead 75 years before the reign of Cyrus  of Nineveh.   In the sacred commentary of the Persian rites,  these words are ascribed to Zoroaster: Deus est accipitris capite. Hei est primus – – inventor But as mankind is naturally prone to folly & superstition & the ancient Egyptians, Syrians & Chaldæans declined from the workshop of the  omnipresent invisible Gold whom o eye hath seen nor can see to worship finite corporeal visible substances, so the  Persians in a short time declined from the re{illeg} of the {illeg} to worship the sun & the fire &  dead men & images.  As the Priests of the Persians were called Ma{g}e Magicians to the  the Persian rel{i}gion  the sacred hymns,  invocations & {ceremonies} used by the Priests in their worship & their skill in divinations were called Magia Magic;  & so all  superstition in al religions is of the same nature with Magic & deserves to be called by that name."

At the end of the contract if all the Tynn then in the Kings hands  (which would be about 95000 Tuns) should be sold at once  the Merchant would scarce give  for it above 30 or 35li per Tun & at 35li per Tun the 4350 Tunns would  be worth  152250li: which being deducted from the total expence leaves 315338li;  the total loss  by the new contract. And this loss is after the rate of 45000li per annum at a Medium."

Her late Majesty contracted with Cornw in Decem. 1703 for 1600 Tunns of Tin stannary weight annually for seven years together at the price of 3li per  besides the Coynage Duty of  4s per  & post groats of 4d per  which she remitted, to them.  She received also about 40 Tunns per annum at the same price from Truro in Devonshire. And after 612 years she renewed the contract 2 Iune 1710 for 1600 Tunns from Cornwal annually during the war & 1800 in times of peace besides about 8{0} Tunns annually from Cornwall at the price of 3li. 9s 4d including the Coynage Duty & Post groats. And in both contracts she sold the Tin to Merchants at the rate of 76li per Tunn merchants weigh. In the time of the first contract the consumption carried off about 1560 Tuns per annum merchants weight, in that of the second about 1260 Tuns merchants weight or 1170 Tunns stannary. For the high price & the war together diminished the consumption & we do find that it begins yet to mend. 
      And if the  Queens Contract for Tin be not renewed the  Commissioners must sell the Tin at so low a price that it may not be worth the whole to  dig so much Tin in Cornwall as will hinder the sale of  a considerable quantity of her Majestys Tinn. How low that price shall be  is difficult to affirm. But since Tin has been sold formerly at 40 or 50li per Ton, it may be presumed that to sell as much of the Queens Tin as shall be sold by Cornwall, (suppose about 650 Tunns per annum, the whole consumption being only about 1260 per annum) the price must come down to 45li per Tun or less.  If  the Trustees could sell 650 Tuns merchants weight per annum at 45li per Tunn the  sale would last eight years & produce an annuity of 29250li during that time. And if the charges of warehouse room selling & accidents,  which may be recconed at  500li per annum or above, be deducted the annuity will be but 28750li per annum. And this Annuity for eight years to come  if the interest be rebated at 5 per cent, is worth at present  185817li, but in eight years time will  produce  230000li for paying off  the Queens debts. 
       The Queens loss by the Tin contracts. A continuation of the present contract would in four years bring the king into a worse condition then the Queen was at her death. The only remedy is for the Owners of the Tin lands  to contract for a less quantity & to prevail with the Queens creditors to consent in writing that the King shall have the Queens Tin at the present value 
        If Cornwall should only dig 400 Tunns stannary weight per annum & the king should contract with them for it at the rate of 3li 9s 4d per : it would be better for them then to have no contract at all & sell only 6 or 7 hundred Tunns per annum at 40 or 45 shillings per  till all the Quens Tin is sold. And therefore if the King should contract with them for six or eight hundred or a thousand Tunns per annum they would have great reason to rejoyce at it. And if he should contract with them for 1100 or 1200 Tuns per annum besides 40 Tunns from Devon it is as much as the consumption will carry off at present. If he contracts with Cornwall it will be requisite that he also buy the Queens Tin of the Commissioners & if he pays for it about 28 or 30 thousand pounds per annum for eight years together, or  an equipollent price in any other mann, they will in my humble opinion have  no reason to complain of the bargain. But if his Majesty buys not the Queens Tin he will be a very great loser by the  contract with Cornwall. For if the  contract should be for three or four years, he would sell no Tin of his own till the end of the contract, & then his own Tin will sell for no more then about 40 or 45s per  unless the contract be renewed."

May it please your Lordship  The last Autumn I laid before your Lordship a Memorial wherein (to the best of my memory) I represented that if Copper worth 1112d per pound weight could be wrought into money by casting, the Copper & Coynage without edging the money would amount unto 1712 per pound weight, & allowing 212d more for the charge of putting off, buying & setting up coyning tools, repairing the buildings, building furnaces, paying Clerk{s} & a Comptroller, & other Incidents; the whole would amount unto 20d per pound weight. And after so much was coyned as was sufficient to supply the present want of copper money (which I recconed might be about 80 or 100 Tunns) the surplus above all charges, if there were any, might be paid into the Exchequer. And in the next coynage after a copper Mint was set up the money might be made heavier. But by further experience it appeared afterwards that such Copper could not be wrought by casting but must be wrought into barrs at the battering Mills. I now beg leave to represent to your Lordship that in my humble opinion the best method of coyning such bars into money, is to receive the same by weight & assay, giving Bills to the Importers & taking back the bills upon delivering back the same weight of Copper in scissel & money together, the Importer paying for the coynage of the money by the pound weight a certain Seigniorage to be accounted for by the Master & Worker. That the Importers will expect about 17d per pound weight above the Seigniorage for their copper & workmanship & for putting off the Copper money.

For such Copper is free from mixture & is of about the same degree of fineness with the Swedish copper money & with copper vessels made at the battering mills. That such copper be made into Fillets or Barrs of a due breadth & thickness either at the battering mills or at the drawing Mills & be received at the Mint upon the Master & Workers Note expressing the weight thereof: & that the Master & Worker upon delivering back to the Importer the same weight {of} copper in Scissel & Money together be discharged of his Receipt; the Importer at the same time paying the Master a certain seigniorage for bearing the charges of the Mint & Coynage, & the Master & Worker being accountable for the Seigniorage alone. The Fillets imported may be assayed by heating a few of them  red hot at one end & trying if they will beare the hammer without cracking. The Assays may be made by the Kings Assay-master or his Clerk or by the Smith, & all persons concerned may be present if they please. The moneys may be assayed before delivery in the following manner. Let a Tunn of copper money (more or less) be very well mixed together, & at each of the four sides of the heap let so much copper money be counted out for a trial as should make a pound weight. And if each of the parcells counted out, makes a pound weight without the error of the weight of an halfpenny, & one or two pieces taken out of each parcel endures the assay by the hammer, then the money to be deliverable; otherwise to be returned to the Moneyers. If the said four parcells differ not in weight from one another, above the weight of a farthing, the tale of the whol{e} Tunn to be estimated in proportion to its weight, as the tale of all the four parcells is to their weight. And these four assays with the weight & tale of every Tunn of copper money to be entred in books. And if the money prove at any time too light or too heavy, the weight may be corrected in the  coynage of the next copper imported, so as to make the whole tale of all the copper money  beare a just proportion to the weight. Two or more pieces of money may be taken out of every Tunn & put into a Pix & tried yearly by such person or persons as the Lord High Treasurer or Lords Commissioners of the Treasury shall appoint. Mr Thomas Eyres a Refiner of Copper proposes to make & size the fillets by a drawing Mill for fifteen pence per pound weight of the blanks cut out of them, whenever the price of fine copper in the market is no higher then at present, vizt 100li per Tunn. And if a penny more be allowed to him for putting away the copper money, & four pence be added for seigniorag{e} the whole will be answered by cutting a pound weight of copper into twenty pence. If the price of fine copper in the market rises or falls, then the price of the fillets to rise or fall  as much. Out of the Seigniorage the Master & Worker may have for himself the Graver & Smith one penny per  pound weight & for the Moneyers two pence, & the remaining penny may be for bearing the charges of weighing, assaying, entring in books, making a Controllment Roll repairing the building buying coyning tools & putting them  into repairs & buying barrells boxes & baggs to put the money into, &c. After the coyning tools are once put into repairs the Moneyers are to keep them in repairs. Mr Eyres hath not yet erected a drawing Mill but proposes that he can do it & be ready to deliver Fillets of Copper within the space of two months The charge of making the Fillets at the Battering Mills & sizing them will be more then at the drawing Mills by three half pence per pound weight of the blancks besides the charge of erecting sizing Mills: which charges make us prefer the other method. The buildings in the Mint where the coynage is to be performed are out of repairs. The Proposalls of Mr Eyres & the Moneyers are hereunto annexed. The Moneyers demand 112d per poundweight for coyining the Blancks, but in the reign of King Charles the 2d had only 1d per poundweight. Mr Eyres demands 7 per cent for putting off the copper money, but is willing to abate so{m}e thing; & we think 5 per cent, or 1d per poundweight sufficient.

But that Indenture becoming void by the death of her said Majesty, & no grant of that place from his present Majesty being entred in the Books of the Treasury, & it not appearing lately that he was alive nor what was his name: he was omitted in the Warrant lately directed to  the General of that Mint for continuing the said Indenture in force. But since it now appears that he is alive, if, in consideration of the services  mentioned in his Petition, his Majesty shall think fit to restore him to that place, it may be done by a Warrant under his Majestys signe Manual directed to  the said General for supplying the omission in the  Warrant above mentioned which was directed to him. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdom."

Sir Iohn Erskins house is on the hither side of the Mountain, Mr Haddons on the further or north side thereof. The silver mine is on the south side of hte Mountain by a gutter which has been made in the side of the mountain by floods of water running down from the side of the mountain & wahing away the earth in long intervalls of time. It is on the west side of this channell neare the bottom of the mountain & on the west side of Sir Iohn's house, about five miles from Stirling & twelve from Perth, on the east side of the way between them & about two miles from Allway a seaport town & in the Parish of Allva. The Mine is just opened, within about two fathom or 212 from the grass which grows on the surface of the earth. In it are two veins of ore running horizontally the one  almost three foot above the other, the upper vein about 22 inches broad from top to bottom & about 18 inches wide, the other about 14 inches broad or deep & about the same wideness with the former. The colour of the Oar a darkish brown, but neare the edges of the vein of a whiter colour like spar with a darker colour of metallick ore intermixed. The dark coloured Ore in the middle of the vein is usually richer. From these two veins Sir Iohn Erskin had the Ore out of which he received 134 Ounces of fine silver before he went into the rebellion. Mr Hamilton smelted that Ore but did not then Oversee the mine, but see the ore raised out of the Mine from the said two veins. And after Sir Iohn went to the Rebells Mr Hamilton by order of the Lady Erskin had the oversight & direction of four miners who dug the Ore from those two veins about four months together or something ab{ove}, {&} {put} {them} up in old Casks (Hogsheads & Barrells {illeg}{)} to the quantity of about 40 Tunns of Ore more or less & hid the Casks on the north west side of the house just by the Gate of the house And then Mr Hamilton came away to London & about a fortnight after went to my Lord Mayor & made an affidavit of what he knew about this matter. About half a mile or three furlongs west from this Burn  or flood-gutter there is some scattered scattered sparr brought down by the watter which spar is a signe of minerals in that gutter & the mineralls may prove either Copper or Silver Ore or both together. But Mr Hamilton doth not yet know what it will prove. And about two miles from this silver mine westward there is a Copper mine which holds a good quantity of silver. Two or three pounds of Ore hold a pound of  Copper, & a pound Averdupois of Copper holds about 24 penny weight of fine Silver more or less. Taken from Mr Hamilton 22th August 1716.  When the silver Mine was first discovered the veine was small & by digging into the mountain is grown bigger & bigger."

May it please your Lordships The design of sending down two Persons wellskilled in assaying and working of minerals, Mr. Brandshagen and Mr. Hamilton, to Sir Iohn Ereskins Mines in the Parish of Alva five miles from Sterling East and by North; being as I presume, that they should in the first place survey the Mine with the Mountain about it and Assay the Ore and make a Report upon the whole that it may certainly appear whether the same be a silver mine and of what value before they begin to dig & work the Ore, and it being intended that in doing this they should act under Mr. Haldane, Senior the Brother in Law of the said Sir Iohn Ereskine, and Mr. Haldane living near the mine and having expressed himself willing to encourage and supervise the said two men and forward their design: I humbly propose pursuant to your Lordships Directions the following Instructions as proper for this purpose. 1. That in the presence of Substantial Witnesses, the said two Persons cause to be broken off from each of the two Veins of Ore which are in the said Mine, about Six or Eight pounds of Ore, and Seal up the same in two papers with Inscriptions upon them denoting what Vein each parcell is taken from: the Inscriptions to be signed by the Witnesses, and the two Parcells to be packed up together and sent to London to the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury to be Assayed in London by their Order. The Witnesses may be Mr. Haldane and one or two of his Sons who are Parliament Men and Mr. Drummond Warden of the Mint at Edinburgh or any other Gentleman of Credit whom my Lord Lauderdale General of the said Mint shall please to send thither for his own Satisfaction, and the Satisfaction of the Government, and any other Person or Persons whom your Lordships shall order to be present. 2 That in the presence of the same Witnesses other pieces of Ore be broken off from each of the two Veins and Assayed  and the Assays reported by the said two persons and repeated once or twice if need be for the Satisfaction of the Witness and Signed by the said Witnesses in Testimony that the Assays were made before them and sealed up and sent also to the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury. And that a Description of the said two Veins in Breadth and depth and  distance from one another be also sent and which way they run and what sort of Earth or Stone the two Veins are lodged in, and what is the depth of the Mine and the distance of each Vein from the Surface of the Mountain, and whether in that Mine  there be any Bedds of Silver or Copper Ore besides the two Veins. 3 That the Casks (or old Hogsheads and Barrells) which were filled with about 40 Tunns of Ore dugg out of the said Mines by Order of the Lady Ereskine in the time of the late Rebellion and buried on the North west Side of her house just by the Gate thereof be enquired after, and a Report made thereof and of what that Ore holds by the Assay. 4 That the Burn or Channel made in the south side of the Mountain by floods running down about three or four Furlongs westward from the Said Mine within Sir Iohn Ereskins part of the Mountain, be well viewed to see what Sparrs and other signs of Minerals or Metalls be found there, to Assay them and Report the Produce. 5 About  two miles westward from this Silver Mine there is a Copper Mine said to be very rich in Copper and Silver so as in a pound weight of Ore to hold about half a pound of Copper and twelve penny weight of Silver, and to belong to one who went into the Rebellion. If two or three pieces of that Ore can be procured, let it be Assayed to See how much Copper & how much Silver it holds. And if there be any other Mines within three or four miles of the Silver Mine, let them  examin what Silver the Ore may contain. 6 Let them view all Sir Iohn Ereskin's part of the Mountain and observe what signs of Minerals may appear any where above ground and report what they find. And let them give the best account they can of any other Mines of Copper or Lead which they can hear of in that Mountain. I humbly propose also that Mr. Haldane. Senior be desired by a Letter from your Lordships to see that the two Gentlemen sent down do put these things in Execution, and to give them Directions from time to time to do what he may think further proper for giving his Majesty and his Royal Highness and your Lordships Satisfaction in this Matter. And that the two Gentlemen sent down be ordered to observe the directions of Mr. Haldane in making these and such like Enquiries and Observations. And that the Earl of Lauderdale General of the Mint at Edenburgh, be also desired by a Letter from your Lordships to give the two Gentlemen sent down his Protection and Encouragement, and to send either Mr Drummond Warden of that Mint or some other intelligent and Credible Person to the Mine, who may there see the Silver Ore dug out of the Rock and Assayed and packed up to be sent to London, and may give his Lordship and the Government an account thereof: And that Mr Hamilton do assist Mr Brandshagen. If this Mine shall prove a true Silver Mine, the Kings Council learned in the Law may be consulted about the Right which either the King may have to it as a Royall Mine, or the Commissioners for the forfeited Estates; and about the Right which either of them may have to the 40 Tunn of Silver Ore already dug up; and about the authority requisite to secure them in order to work the Mine and Smelt the Ore, and also about the Kings Right in the Copper Mine two miles westward as a Royall Mine rich in Silver, tho not belonging to Sir Iohn Erskine. And when the Fact and the Law is known, the Silver Mine and the Ore may be seized as the Law shall direct, and the Kings  Right in the other Mine may be also asserted. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great Wisdome  Mint Office 25. Aug. 1716."

By the description which I have lately met with it is not a round vein like the body of a tree but a broad flat vein  like the leafe of a Table. It is about four five or six inches thick for the thickness varies. It is covered over on either side with a crust of spar about six inches thick{. The} spar is mixed with some Ore, but the Ore in the middle between the two crusts of spar is the richest & the whole thickness of the Ore & spar together is about 17 or 18 inches. This b{roa}d vein runs both downwards from the  bottom of the levell & also northwards from the further end of the levell proceeding both downwards & northwards into the mountain like a wall rising up from the foundations of the mountain almost to the top of it & running cross the mountain from north to south. I send you this description that you may examin it. And if it be true, you will find the vein of Ore not only at the bottom of the levell under the shaft but also at the further end of the Levell, rising up from the bottom of the Levell to a considerable height at the  northern side of the Mine. This account I had from one who has seen the place. And I send it to you that if all the rubbish be not carried out of the Levell, you may cause it to be carried out till you come to the firm rock at the further end of it & there observe if you can find any signes of the vein running northwards into the Mountain For its possible that Iames Hamilton might there see two pieces of this vein & take them for two veins running upon a levell north & south. I am told that they began to dig the Ore at the bottom of the Levell & so dug it upwards letting it drop down into the Level as fast as they broke it off from the rock. And therefore its probable that some part of the vein may be found above the bottom of the Levell at that end thereof next the mountain. If upon searching, you & Mr Hamilton make any new discovery, you need not give my Lord Lauderdale & Mr Drummond any trouble about this particular but only acquaint Mr Haddon of Gleneagles there with if he is at his house during these Holydays, & send me an account thereof as soon as you can."

[2] During the rest of the Winter the Miner and one more were picking such Small pieces of that thread of Ore as the Hardness of the Rocks in which it lay would allow them. [3]Till about the Month of Aprill your Memorialist sett two Men more to Work to digg up what they could of this Ore about which time they found great variety of Ores, some Rich in silver, some Copper and some they Could make no Iudgement of, neither give any Name to, never being able to reduce it to any kind of Mettal.

That in Iuly your [5]Memorialist was perswaded to make a farther Tryall, where the Ore was found in April, and in some Weeks Work, the Vein appeared more promising but this happened a very little only before he Left his own House. That Your Memorialist is informed,[6] the Miner and Diggers found the same variety of ore as formerly and that such parts of the Ore, as most resembled what upon former Tryals was found best, was melted down, the rest whether Ore or resembling Ore without Tryal or distinction was put in Casks and hid near to the House where Your Memorialist believes it still lys.

All three understand the smelting of ores, & can consult & advise one another & therefore may each of them work apart in several furnaces for making the greater dispatch, unless they find it more convenient to work together at one or two great furnaces. I make this Proposal upon presumption that the Ore is worth smelting because it was buried in Casks for that reason, & that they can find a convenient place for setting up one or more furnaces. As fast as the Cakes of silver come from the Test, they may be marked with the Roman numbers I. II. III. IV. V. VI &c stamped on them with a chissel; & a list of the number & weight of every Cake may from time to time be sent up to your Lordships or your Order, that the weight & value of all the silver extracted may be ascertained for preventing imbusselments. And when these Cakes are melted into large Ingots, the Ingots may be numbered & weighed in the same manner. And the number & weight of every Regulus or lump of coarse silver got out of a pot of ore may be entred in books.

Altho it's a Nation laid down by some, and with much earnestness advanced by others, that Silver is the only Measure of Trade, yet the Use of almost all Times and Places proves that Gold, when coin'd, has obtain'd (if not by Law, yet by Custom) the denomination of Money as well as Silver; and since We, and almost all other Nations, do make our Money of Gold and Silver, for that Reason it is that we ought to be careful in observing a right proportion between these two valuable Metals: for if we over-value our Gold, Foreigners will bring us that, and export our Silver: and if on the contrary we over-value our Silver, they'll give us Silver, and carry away our Gold: so that there lies a necessity upon us of settling our Proportion of one Metal to the other (that is, of considering how many Grains or Ounces of the one is equal in value to a Grain or an Ounce of the other) according to the other Nations.  For in this respect (since we and they have Money of both Metals) they must and will be a Rule.  For let the Denomination of our Money be what it will (that being arbitrary and in our own Power) yet the proportion between the two Metals is not so but in the universal Power of others, and is observ'd according to the Plenty or Scarcity of one or the other Metal in the World.  If therefore this be not observ'd by us, it will become exceedingly detrimental to us, even to the loss of either most of our Gold or Silver Money.  [By the way I must affirm (whatsoever some do urge to the contrary) that Gold Coins are Money as well as Silver: Custom, the great Commander of all things, has made it so here, and in most, if not all, other Nations.]  And since this proportion has been lately under the Debate and Consideration of Tour House, as I saw it in your Votes; and perceiving that you order'd the Commissioners of Trade to lat before the House their Estimate, I did not doubt but those Gentlemen had done it with more exactness than my private Circumstances will allow me to be capable of.  But since you are pleased to signify the contrary, and also (tho late) to desire my Opinion what the Gold of a Guinea is worth, or how much Silver it's esteem'd equal to in other Countries; I therefore once more obey your Command, and shall give you what Calculations I have been able to make; which if not so exact and critical as a matter of this nature deserves, yet I hope it may give some farther light into this business.   In order to which, I shall first observe, That the general way which the Merchants and even Goldsmiths themselves (who one would think should understand much better) take to compute this proportion by, is absolutely false; for in respect of our home Coins, they generally value Gold by Weight, and Silver by Tale: e. g.  If you say a Guinea is worth 22 s. one of these men shall presently most absurdly ask you, What you reckon Gold at per Ounce? Whereas the Question should be, How many grains of Silver do you reckon equal to a Grain of Gold? And so in respect of Foreign Money {illeg} ridiculously measure it by the course of Exchange, and compute the Gold Coin of one Country by the Silver Coin of another; and so not weigh, but tell the Money: both which are such false and perverse methods, that I admire judicious persons should be found guilty of them. But the true way to find out this proportion, is, to weigh the Gold and Silver Coins of any Country or Nation, and then consider how many Grains or Ounces of Silver (in the esteem of that Nation) are equal in value to one Grain or Ounce of Gold.  As for example; If the Persians did formerly value 10 Talents of Silver to be worth in their Kings Taxes 1 Talent of Gold, and the Subjects of that Empire were left at liberty to pay either Gold or Silver into the Treasury, according to this rate, it's then manifest that (if their Weights were reduced to ours) they took 1 grain or 1 ounce of Gold to be equal in value to 10 grains or to 10 ounces of Silver.  And so in the same manner, now in Spain 17 d.wtl 12 grs. of Gold (which is the weight of their Double-doubloon or 4 Pistol piece) is esteem'd to be equal, and accordingly passeth in all common Payments for 16 Silver Dollers or Pieces of Eight, each of which is 17 d.wt. 12 grs. By which it's apparent, that now in Spain, 16 grains or 16 ounces of Silver, are esteem'd but of equal value to 1 grain or one ounce of Gold. But now in regard almost all Nations have Standards of their Money peculiar to themselves, i. e.  they observe a different proportion of Alloy to be added to such a quantity of pure Gold or pure Silver for coining of their Money; therefore for us to measure the true proportion between Gold and Silver observ'd by other Nations, we must take one of these two following methods. 1. Either we must reduce both their Gold and Silver Coins to an absolute Fineness, and then weigh them, and compute how they are valued one against the other. 2. Or else we must reduce their Standard to ours, both of their Gold and Silver, and then make our Computation.   And this is the way which I have taken in the ensuing Calculation. And since I make our own Standard to be the Rule of all others, I shall therefore begin with our own Coins. According to the Indenture between the King and the Mint-Master here in England,  1 pound of Silver of 11 ounces 2 d.wt. fine, i. e. 11 ounces 2 d.wt. of fine Silver, and 18 d.wt. of Copper, which is call'd the Alloy, is to be coin'd into 3 l. 2 s. by Tale: and 1 pound of Gold at 22 Carrats fine, i.e.  22 Carrats of fine Gold, and 2 Carrats of Alloy, is to be coin'd into 4412 Guineas.  Now each Guinea, according to this Contract, ought to be in weight 5 d.wt. 9 gr{3899}, or 129 gr. and {3899}, as appears by dividing 5760 gr. which is the pound of Gold, into 4412 Guineas.  This lately did (before your Vote) answer in value (according as the proportion between Gold and Silver was esteem'd here in England) to 22 s. in Silver, which is near (according to the Indenture for Silver) about 2044 grains of Silver. The proportion then (allowing the Guinea at 22 s.) here in England stands thus; 129{3899} grains of Gold
        
         <131v> 
        
        are equal to almost 2044 grains of Silver, which is almost 16 to 1. viz. 1534 grains or ounces, and somewhat more of Silver, is esteem'd to be equal but to 1 grain or 1 ounce of Gold. Having thus consider'd our own, I shall now set down the proportion of our European Neighbours. And because Italy is the most remote from us of any neighbouring Nation (I think) we are much concern'd with in matters of Money, I shall begin with Venice. [1]The chief Gold Coin in Venice (if not the only) is the Chekeen or Zacheen, which in weight is 2 d.wt. 5 gr. in fineness it's 23 Carrats 312 gr. fine, which is almost fine Gold, being 1 Carrat 312 gr. better then the Standard of England: this being brought down to our Standard, will make of Gold, as good as our Guineas about 2 d.wt. 912 gr. of 5712 gr.[2]  This at Venice is accounted equal to 3 Ducats of Silver and 12 Sols, as a Guinea here was lately accounted equal to 22 s.  The Silver Ducat, as I am told, ought to weigh 14 d.wt. 18 gr. tho I confess I have weigh'd as many as I could meet with, but never met with any above 14 d.wt. 1712 gr.  The Fineness of the Ducat, according to the double Assay which I procured to be made on one of them (for I confess I have been a little curious on this Subject) is 1 ounce 4 d.wt. worse that our Standard.[3]  Their Ducat is 124 Sols; and 3 Ducats and 12 Sols of Silver are by them accounted equal to 1 Chekeen are Gold.  The Silver of these 3 Ducats and Sols is about 1096 gr. which recued to our Standard will be about 978 gr. (as will appear to any that shall make the Calculation.) So that the Venetian Coins being reduced to our Standard, do stand thus; 5712 gr. of Gold are equal to 978 of Silver, which is near about 17 to 1. i. e.  1 gr. or 1 ounce of Gold is esteem'd at Venice equal to 17 gr. or 17 ounces of Silver.  So that if a Guinea were made into Venetian Gold Coin, reductis reducendis, &c. a Guinea at Venice would be worth about 2194 gr. of Silver, which if coin'd into our Money, would be 1 l. 3 s. 6 d. and some small matter more. Next to Venice I should have consider'd Legorn, but that I am told that the Great Duke of Tuscany coins no Gold; and as to Rome, Genoa, and other little States, I think them too inconsiderable to affect us in respect of our Money: therefore I shall next proceed to Spain.  But before I speak any thing of the Coins of this Dominion, which is vastly large, containing not only Spain it self, Naples, Sicilia here in Europe, but also all the richer part of America, which is the chief Fountain of Treasure to Europe; I shall crave leave to remark that the Standards of Spain of France, and England, are generally esteem'd so little different both in Gold and Silver, that they are usually taken for all.  I do acknowledge, I have heard that there is some difference in respect of the Gold, and also in respect of the Silver of Spain, that some of the Spanish Dollars, viz. those of Sevil, are a small matter better; but then those of Mexico are rather worse than our Standard.  But the difference is so little, that it's esteem'd by Goldsmiths not worth observation: I will therefore conclude 'em (according to the general acceptation) all one.  And then if this be allow'd, the proportion in Spain is just 16 to 1. i. e. 16 gr. or ounces of Silver are equal to 1 gr. or ounce of Gold: and then our Guinea, or the Gold of a Guinea, if coin'd in Spain, would be esteem'd there equal to 2064 gr. of Silver (which is 20 gr. more than its worth in England, reckoning the Guinea at 22 s. which 7064 gr. of Silver, if coin'd into our Silver Money, would be about 142 s. 2 d. {14} As to Portugal, it has been but lately a C{illeg} the Dominion of Span, and as to their Money (tho they are now an independent Kingdom, yet) I am inform'd as to the proportion between Gold and Silver, it's very little differing, if not exactly the same with Spain.  I therefore pass on to France. And here their Gold Coins are the Louis d' Or or Pistol, which in weight is the same with the Spanish, viz. 4 d.wt. 8 gr.   And this, in France, is look'd upon equal to 4 Crowns, abating 3 Sous, of which 65 make the French Crown.   The weight of the French Crown is 17 d.wt. 12 gr. and this being reduced to Grains, will stand thus:[4] The Pistol of 4 d.wt. 8 gr. or 104 gr. of Gold, is equal to 4 Crowns wanting 3 Sous, or 1661 Grains of Silver, which is 1534 and 92104 to 1; or 1534 and 92104 gr. of Silver are esteem'd equal in France to 1 gr. of Gold.[5] By which proportion it appears, that a Guinea in France (if made their Coin) is worth about 2060 gr. of Silver, which (if made our Coin) would be about 1 l. 2 s. 2 d. {14}. So that by this Calculation it's manifest that Gold in England, allowing the Guinea to pass for 22 s, is set at a lower rate than in Italy, Spain , Portugal, or France; for in Venice it answers to as much Silver as is in 1 l. 3 s. 6 d of our Money.  In Spain to 1 l. 2 s. 2 d. {34}.  In Portugal the same.  In France to 1 l. 2 s. 2 d. 14.  But in England it's now but 1 l. 1 s 6 d. And lately, before we sunk its value it was 1 l. 2 s.  Which shews that those Nations (if we ow'd them Money) would covet our Gold rather than our Silver, tho we kept our Guinea at 22 s. and doubtless if their Mints were open, and their Coinage gratis, as ours is, they would carry away our Gold, and give us Silver. But now there remains Holland, Sweden, Denmark, and all Germany, to be accounted for.  And here I must confess, that the Calculation of the Money of these Nations I have found to be far more difficult than all the before mentioned; for tho I have consulted Jews and Natives of those Countries, yet I must acknowledg my self still very much in the dark in respect of their Coins.  Their Dollers are so multifarious, their Weight and Fineness so very different, that it must be a Person that {illeg} pence, that his Authority at the Mint in procuring Assays, and that has a great deal of Leisure to make Calculations, that must give an exact and critical Account of all the Proportions in these Countries. Yet however, that I may not seem, after all my Enquiry, to have found nothing, I shall set own what I have either obtain'd from Information, or what I have collected from the Accounts of Mr. Reynolds, who belong'd to the publick Mint about 40 years ago, and has publish'd a Book of Tables for the reducing of the Standard, and have given an account of the Fineness and Coarsness of several Coins both Gold and Silver. I observe then, that the Gold Coin seems to be  the same not only in Holland, but over all the Empire, viz. the Ducat.  As to its weight, I am told by most, it's the same with the Venetian Checkeen, which is 2 d.wt. 5gr.   And tho I have weigh'd some which have answer'd that weight, yet I saw one which was coin'd in Holland which weigh'd a grain more, which is the same weight which Reynolds gives to the

Hungarian Ducat.  As to its Fineness, it's allow'd by all the Merchants, Goldsmiths, and Jews that I have met with, to be somewhat coarser than the Hungarian Ducat, but how much none could exactly tell me.  Now the Hungarian Ducat is 23 Carrats, 2 gr. fine.  I'll therefore take it to be of our Standard 256 gr. of Gold; and by this Computation I think I cannot err above half a grain (if I err at all.) This in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany, is sometimes 2 Rix Dollers and 3 Stivers; sometimes 4, 5, or 6 Stivers, sometimes more, sometimes less, according as Gold Money is more or less in Demand. The Rix Doller is there 48 Stivers, and the Rix Doller of the Empire, according to Reynolds, is 18 d wt. 15 gr. tho I confess I have weigh'd several, but never found any above 18 d.wt. 1412 gr.  I'll take the true weight to be 18 d.wt. 14 gr.  As to the Fineness of the Rix Dollar, according to Reynolds it's 7 d.wt. 12 worse. Agreeable then to this Computation, the Coins in these Countries will run thus: 2 Rix Dollers, 3, 4, 5, or 6 Stivers (I'll take 4 Stivers) will about about 898 gr. of English Standard Silver, and this is equal to 56 gr. of Gold, their weight of the Ducat, which is 16 to 1 and something more, and is near the same proportion with Spain; and therefore the Guinea there is about 1 l. 2 s. 2 d. 34 In Holland 5 Gilders, 4, 5, or 6 Stivers, are esteem'd equal to the Ducat of Gold.  The 3 s. Gilder pieces I have weigh'd, and have found some 1 oun. 6 gr. some 1 oun. 5 gr. and some not above 3 gr. I'll suppose the true weight to be 1 oun. 5 gr.[6]  As to its Fineness, I have been told by Jews and others, that they are equal to the Flanders Duccatoon (I confess, because I have question'd this, I have had an intention to get one of them assay'd, but have not yet had an opportunity.)  But supposing them of this Fineness, which is 4d.wt. 12 better, then the Money in Holland will be thus: 5 Gilders 5 Stivers brought to our Standard will be 865 gr. of Silver, which answers to the Ducat, or 56 gr. of Gold, which is 152256 or almost 1512 to one.  And according to this reckoning, our Guinea in Holland will answer to 1992 gr. of Silver, or about 1 l. 1 s. 5 d. 12 in Coin. This, Sir, is the fairest, and fullest Account I am able to lay before you of the Proportions of Gold and Silver in our neighbouring Countries, computed by their Coins: And tho I may, for want of a right Information, have fall'n into some Mistakes, yet I know it's in your power to cause those to be rectified, by commanding an Assay to be made on all Foreign Coins, which I shall take leave to affirm, is the only true way to find out the right Proportion between Gold and Silver. I acknowledge there's one Great Objection to be made against what I here offer; which is, If this Calculation be true, what's the Reason so much Gold is brought to the Mint, but no Silver? To this I shall answer,  1. It's impossible that we should have either Gold or Silver brought to the Mint, unless we obtain it by an Over-ballance in Trade, since we have no Mines of our own; and when that happens, that Nation that is in debt will pay us in that Metal which will be most for their Advantage.  Now tho we did value our Gold too low, in respect of Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and Germany, when we valued the Guinea at 22 s. yet we did value it too high in respect of Holland: and therefore they brought in Gold rather than Silver. And it's only from Holland we have received the Gold that has been lately brought to our Mint; none has been brought from any other place; for if others owe us Money, they pay their over-balance of Trade in Silver, which is most for their Interest, in regard they set their Gold higher that we.  And farther, I do not believe that any other Gold has been sent from Holland upon the account of that Nation (I will not answer for our own People here at home) than what has been due on the Ballance of Trade, in regard I am told taht ever since the Peace, if not before, the Course of Exchange has been to our Advantage; which I take to be a manifest Argument that they are in our Debt, not we in theirs, and therefore they could not well fetch away our Silver. 2. But in the next place, All Goldsmiths and others can easier make their Advantages by bringing Gold than Silver to the Mint, and that has help'd forward the Coinage of Gold.  And this by an Invention which is call'd Culling, i. e.  Picking out the lightest pieces and putting them off, and melting down the heavier, and fending them back again unto the Mint.  For tho each Guinea ought to weigh as before observ'd 5 d.wt. 9 gr. 3982, yet one shall hardly find 1 among 100 that exceeds, 5 d.wt. 8 gr. some not above 7 gr. and others hardly 6 gr. yet all are passable as if of full weight..  Now here in England, where the Metal in the Ingot is equal in value to that in the Coin, because the Mintage costs nothing, that being born at the National Charge. If the pound of Gold costs the Goldsmith 48 l. 19 s. which is 4 l. 1 s. 7 d. per ounce, and is as much as it ought to be when coin'd allowing (Guineas at 22 s. a piece) yet since the lighter Guineas of 5 d.wt. 8 gr. or 5 d.wt. 7 gr. are put off, and all the heavier sent back to the Tower, after they have past a pilgrimage thro the Melting-pot; it appears, that in 4412 light Guineas of 5 d.wt. 8 gr. each, about 11 s. is sav'd; and if those of 5 d.wt. 7 gr. are only put off, about 18 s. is sav'd; and if only 4 l. 1 s. is pay'd per ounce, as our Coiners of Gold have seldom pay'd more, than about 7 s. more is saved; and all this got only by carrying Gold to the Mint.  And supposing the Gold was bought in Holland where the Metal in Ingot is much Cheaper than in the Coin, in regard there the State only Coins, and gets an Advantage by the Mint, as well as make the Money pay the charge
        
         <132v> 
        
        (which all Governments do, except England) then there, is gain'd 2 or 3 per Cent. more; and this quick advtange must occasion the Coinage of Gold rather than Silver. 3.   But the chiefest reason why no Silver has been brought to the Mint, proceeds (not from the overvaluing of Gold as by mistake is apprehended but) from the prodigious Demand of Silver to carry to the East-Indies; for not only all the Silver due from Spain is sent thither by Ships, which go first for Cadiz to take in Plate, and from thence sail for India, not only all the Pieces of 8 brought from Jamaica, &c. are now bought up at 5s. 7d. or 5s. 8d. per ounce, and some have offered more (which observe by the way is giving 1 ounce and 40 or 50 grains of Silver for only 1 ounce of the same Silver in fineness, and this is Matter of Fact) but also, as I have been well inform'd, the New and Old East-India Companies have lately bought, or at least have given Commission to buy 280000 l. worth of Spanish Dollers in Holland for that service, so that it's no wonder, since such mighty Quantities of Pieces of 8 have by these two Companies been sent, or are now sending into India, that no Silver should be brought to the Mint.  This perhaps may make You, and some few Persons more, consider with a just sedateness of mind, the mischiefs of the East-India Trade, as it's now managed; but I add nothing on this Topick, because I perceive our Wives are resolved not to quit the Gentile Atlass, not the well dy'd Callico; and They (We know) must, and will govern. Your House has been pleased to entertain this Notion, that we set our Gold higher than other Nations; tho (if I mistake not) it's manifest we set it lower than every body except Holland; and when they please to raise it never so little, We are also now higher than They.  This has given an occasion of great Confusion in all Payments, and has put a mighty Hardship on the poorer sort of Tradesmen, who are still constrain'd, by their Necessities, to take Guineas at 22 s. tho those to whom they pay them will receive 'em but at 21 s. 6 d.  It has given the Stock-Jobbers a new handle to work with, and our rich Merchants are resolv'd to make up their Accounts by this Uncertainty to their own Advantage. And tho some have a plausible Pretence, that Gold will find its own Value; yet the Value being now made uncertain, the Event will be this; that for a little Time, They that are least able to bear the loss will be forced to take Guineas at 22 s. and yet by a fatal Necessity be constrain'd to pay 'em at 21 s. 6 d as it's already too apparent, till in a little time some few of the lightest will pass for 21 s. 6 d. but all the rest will sink into the Melting-pot, become gold Rings, &c. or march to the other side of the Water as {So}on as the Dutch have recruited their stock of Silver, and then make a Rise of Gold. I'll add but one Observation more, and then trouble you no farther; and that's in relation to the Mint it self.  I believe there's no Nation in the World besides England that gives every body leave to coin Money gratis: I shall not search into the Policy that first put that Project on foot; doubtless our Parliament had good Reason for what they did when they establish'd a free Mintl and questionless it would still be for the publick Benefit, if it were restrain'd only to Silver.  But as it's now left open to both Metals, it must become very detrimental; for as it puts upon the extreamest Niceties of setting our Gold and Silver in the most exact proportion according to our Neighbours in general, so also it offers at impossibilities, by obliging us to have Gold and Silver in an exact proportion to other Nations in particular; which can never be done, till we can perswade all the World to set their Gold and Silver at 17, or 16, or 1512, or 15 to 1, and every Nation to keep to it constantly: for now tho we undervalue our Gold (allowing the Guinea to be 22 s.) in respect of Italy, Spain, France, &c. yet we overvalue it in respect of Holland.  And since there, only the States have the Privilege of Coining, as in all other nations (except here) it must necessarily follow that Gold there is cheaper in the Ingot that in the Coin, and this also adds to their encouragement to send us Gold rather than Silver.  I therefore conclude, that if your House had been pleas'd to have taken away the Coinage of Gold, i. e. to have oblig'd every person that brings Gold to the Mint to have paid the Charge of Coining:  This would have cur'd the Mischief of Culling.  And if Guineas had still past at 22 s. (which by the way I take leave to affirm is their justest Value, with regard to other Nations) it would never have been prejudicial, but an Advantage unto us.  And if you do not sometime or other take care of this very matter, by either This or some better Expedient, it will, sooner or later, turn to our Detriment.  It's vain to urge that Guineas were first coin'd at 20 s. apiece, since so were the Soveraigns in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and so were the Unites or Jacobus's under King Iames I. and so the Carolus's under King Charles I.  But all those Princes saw the necessity of raising their Gold, as they frequently did by Proclamation.  For since the Invention of the American Mines, far greater Quantities of Silver have been imported into Europe than Gold, and that has gradually rais'd the Value of Gold above Silver much beyond the antient proportions; for as the Plenty of the one Metal depreciates That, so the Scarcity of the other raises its Estimation.  I confess if we could make all our Money only of Silver, it would give us freedom from the trouble and perplexities which will ever now and anon arise about these Proportions; but since the Custom of other Nations as well as our own has order'd it otherwise, it's therefore above our Reach (especially at present, now we want the Species of Money) to take hold of an Alteration. I could add some more Hints, which perhaps you might be pleas'd to read over, viz.  Of the Proportion between Gold and Silver in other parts of the World besides Europe, especially the Indies, and China, &c. Of the present Management of the East-India Trade, and of the Damage which must inevitably ensue by establishing two East-India Companies.  But this being too long for a Letter, I shall conclude that what I have here written is matter of fact, and therefore easily discern'd whether true or false; and tho I will not affirm I have not committed any mistake, yet this with all solemnity I will boldly assert, I have not designedly err'd either to one side or the other.  All that I doubt if is in respect of the Dutch and German Coins, and these I must confess I have in a great Measure taken upon Report.  My Province and Business in the World disobliges me from any Interest either one way or the other, any more than as I am encompast in the publick Welfare of the Nation; which that That may prosper, and that the wise Counsels of your House may daily contribute to it, is the hearty Wish of, S I R, Your Humble Servant"

The present Grievances under which we labour are, The great want of Silver-Coyn to carry on Trade, and the heaving Debts, occasion'd by the late War. It is needless to spend much time to prove, That there is a great scarcity of Silver-Coyn among us, most of our Merchants, and all our Tradesmen feel it; and any person may soo be satisfy'd of the truth hereof, by sending even into the heart of the City to get a few Guineas exchang'd for Silver, though it is much worse in Out-parts; he that now can get a small Bill paid in Silver, esteems it a much greater favour, than a few years ago; he accounted it to be paid a large summe in Gold. The Reasons of this great scarcity of our Silver-Coyn among us, Notwithstanding all that has been formerly coyn'd in our several Mints, are these following. We undervalue Silver in the Mint, both with respect to our selves at home, and our neighbours abroad As to our selves, The Goldsmiths give 5s: 3d an ounce for that very silver, for which the Mint gives but 5s: 2d, The consequences of this are, No Silver goes to the Mint to be coyn'd, And that which has already been Coyn'd at a very great Expence to the Nation, is either carry'd abroad in specie, or melted down at home, to be refined, made coarser, wrought up, or exported in Ingots. Being a penny an Ounce cheaper than the very same Silver can be had any other way; A Refiner formerly thought a farthing an Ounce a sufficient profit in Melting Silver, It must needs therefore be a very great temptation to the Melting down our Silver-Coyn, when he that do's it now, gets a penny an Ounce by it, and sometimes more; And thus it has been, ever since the incouragement ceas'd for carrying Silver to the Mint to be
        
         <585v> 
        
        coyn'd. And this Mischief will continue as long as we have any Money left among us, by the melting down of which, such a profit can be made. As to our Neighbours, it is as plain, That they draw away our Silver from us, Not so much by our putting no value upon the Coynage, As by our making it of less value by coyning; For, before it is coyn'd, it is worth 5s: 3d an Ounce, when coyn'd, it is worth but 5s: 2d, and as soon as ever the Kings Image is defaced in the Melting-pot, it is worth 5s: 3d again. Of this weakness of our's, Our Neighbours have long made a very great advantage to themselves, Who have abundance of Silver and a flourishing-Trade, which we are distress'd extreamly, by the avarice of some particular persons, who have indeed got great Estates to themselves, out of the ruins of the Publick, by melting down or exporting our Silver-Coyn. It is much easyer to get English Silver-Coyn in Holland, than in England; Our Crowns and half Crowns are carry'd over thither, notwithstanding our Laws. Because they go for more there, than they will here, and because the Mints there give a profit to all that bring them thither; Whereas, they that carry Silver to our Mint to be coyn'd must lose a penny by every ounce they carry. None of the Dutch-Money is ever melted down or brought over hither, unless it be by meer accident. Not because of any Law that forbids Melting or exporting it, But, because every one that do's it, knows he loses by so doing. Our English-Money being seldom weigh'd & (it it appear to be Standard, & coyn'd in the Tower) never suspected, The Iews in Holland have fall'n into the way of washing it, whereby they make to themselves a profit of near 7 per Cent, and return our Money to us so much lighter, though as fair to the Eye as ever it was, notwithstanding the Letters on the Edges; And 'tis very probable, There e're long they will wash away 
        
         <586r> 
        
        four times as much, if a speedy stop be not put to that pernicious practice.     The Clippers formerly when they foudn we would bear our Hammer'd-Money a little clipt, they (doubtless) went over with it again, And though the Dutch-Money is only hammer'd, & very easy to be wash'd or Clipt, Yet, it do's not appear to be in the least diminished, otherwise than by the ordinary wear thereof, The reasons of it's being so spared, are it's coarseness, & it's being sorted, & taken by weight, when receiv'd in any considerable summe. The Remedys proposed are, To put a value upon our Coynage, to make it an advantage to every one that brings Bullion or Foreign-Coyn to the Mint, and to render it a loss to him that shall melt down, diminish, or Export our Coyn. If a Bill for this purpose passes, Every one will bring or send Bullion, Wrought-Plate or Foreign-Coyn to the Mint, while there is a profit to be made that way, & when it is once coyn'd, No man in his Wits will melt it down, wash or export it when he knows he shall lose by so doing; There will then be no need of any Law to forbid it, Every Man's Interest being the best security for it's preservation. It is proposed, that the Money be made of a coarser Alloy than the present standard, about 12 per Cent. That about 2 per Cent thereof be allow'd to him or her that brings Gold or Silver to the Mint; 2 per Cent to defray teh charge of Coynage, And the other 8 per Cent towards paying off the Publick-Debts, which will soon ease the subject in the present Taxes, Customs and Excise, reduce the rate of Interest and make Trade flourish. Here it will be objected, That if we make our Money coarser, Goods will rise in proportion, That is to say, If we put but ii pennyworth of Silver in a Shilling, no Merchant or Tradesman will give us any more than ii pennyworth of Goods for that piece, which we shall then call a Shilling; Or, which is the same thing, Every one
        
         <586v> 
        
        that parts with his Goods, will see to it, That he has the intrinsick value thereof in Money. To this it is answer'd, That as to his Majesty's own subjects, The same Authority that raises the value of our Money on account of the Coynage, in order to increase & preserve it among us, may also if they see it necessary, forbid under very severe Penaltys the advanceing the price of Goods on that account, But it is absolutely necessary to set bounds to the prices of Gold & Silver in Bullion, &  in foreign-Coyn brought among us, So that they shall never be so high aas the same Gold & Silver in our Coyn, and though by such a Law, A value will be put on the Workmanship, And Money will be plentyfull, yet other Gold and Silver will remain a Commodity still, & the value of all Goods will naturally rise or fall in proportion to the plenty or scarcity of such Goods, and the Demands there are for them. If this Objection intends only the subjects of his Majesty, There is nothing at all in it, Because they must take the Coyn as the Law directs, and we find nobody raises the value of their Goods, though they are paid in our Copper Coyn, which is not half the intrinsick value of our Silver, or in six pences that are not so valuable as our Crowns and half Crowns, But, we find a considerable value is put on the Coynage in all other Countreys, particularly in Holland, where the greatest part of their Currant Money is above 16 per Cent worse than our's, and yet it will purchase (within one per Cent) aas much as our's, and quite as much as the best of their own Current Money, And yet, nobody sets a price on his Goods in Holland according to the intrinsick value of the Money he is to be paid in; you may purchase there One hundred ounces of the very finest Silver in Bullion; with 84 Ounces of fine-Silver in their Money; as appears by an exact Assay made at the Tower of London, by one that has been several Months in  Holland to look into this affair; And yet there appears as little Counterfeit Coyn in Holland as in England, By this Means the Dutch (and the rest of the Northern-States) draw away our Money more
        
         <587r> 
        
        than that of any other Nation, Because all others put a value on the Coynage, Whereas we on the contrary, by our present management, make our Silver less valuable by coyning it, And that has made it (for many years past) so advantageous to the Dutch &ca: to melt down our Money, and recoyn it in their own Mints, And that they have effectually secured from ever returning to us again by making it go for more at home, than it will abroad. But it will be said, That Foreigners will not take our Money according to the value we put upon it, if we raise it. To this it is answer'd, That if our Money be rais'd in it's value on account of the Coynage (which indeed no Foreigner will have any regard to) It is the very thing we aim at; Foreigners having for many years past, taken so much of our Coyn, is one of the principal Reasons that we have so little of it left, And it is to be hoped, it will not be thought any disadvantage to us, when a Foreigner carrys away our Goods, & leaves our Money behind him, which is the very case in Holland, and other Countreys, where any considerable value is put on the Coynage; No wise man will bring away Dutch-Money, by which he must lose 16 per Cent, when he can lay out the Money he receives in Holland, in Goods; though by those Goods ('tis probable) he can make but two per Cent; Or, he can there get forreign-Coyn for his Dutch-Money, for about One per Cent loss to him. But, the mighty Objection remains, And that is, Exchange will rise hereby, And the Merchant that sells Goods abroad for England, will raise the price of his Good{s} in proportion to the advance of our Coyn, because he will have no regard to what new names we give our Money; If he sells us now four hundred Ounces of coarse Silver for a hundred pound Sterling, If in a hundred pound of our new Coyn, we shall have but ninety pounds worth of Silver, then he will tell us, he must have 111li: 2s: 2d12 in our new Coyn; and so, if we lose the Ballance of 
        
         <587v> 
        
        Trade, our Money must go abroad, notwithstanding this advance of our Coyn. Answer: Supposing the Premises to be true, yet the conclusion is wrong, Because, that Foreign-Merchant that has a hundred and eleven pounds two shillings & 212 here by a Bill of Exchange for his 400 Ounces of Foreign-Silver, will order it to be laid out here; For, he knows it will purchase 111li: 2s: 2d12 worth of Goods here, But, if he carrys it abroad, it will  pass for no more than One hundred pounds, Because Our money when sent into another Countrey, is then Foreign, And no Nation will take it abroad for any more than it's intrinsick value, They will have no regard to the Workmanship we bestow on it if  it be never so costly, However, to prevent any alteration or puzzle of this nature, the Bill may provide Bullion of the very same value with the Money which we now have, to pay all foreign Bills of Exchange, and that without any change or trouble to the Merchant. The great scarcity of our Silver-Coyn is not only the occasion of the badness of Trade (for the Consumer is not so free to lay out his money when he has but little, as when he has a plenty,) But this scarcity of Money is also a ruin to the Merchant & Trader, who is hereby obliged to give above six times the Credit that is given in Holland, and other places where Money is plentifull; We give here generally 9, 10 & 12 Months Credit, whereas in Holland they give but six Weeks or twoo Months, And we may easily from hence see, one of the chief Reasons why there are so many Bankrupts and ruin'd Familys here, & so few there,  And how it comes to pass That the Dutch can undersell us even in our own Product & Manufactures. About Seven Months ago, a very great Man discoursing on the scarcity of our Silver-Coyn, said, if we would have patience, There would soon be Silver enough come from the West-Indies, It would be worth while to enquire, how much of that which lately came from thence, has been sent to our Mint, And what Silver has been imported for 15 Year's past, and how much of it has been coyn'd at the Tower, It is to be fear'd, there will be found little or none. To the alteration of our Coyn, it has been Objected, That by the Act for the Vnion of the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland Anno Regni quinto Annæ Reginæ, It was enacted that from and after the Vnion, The Coyn shall be of the same standard and value throughout the Vnited Kingdom, as then in England, And a Mint shall be continued in Scotland under the same rules as the Mint in England, and the present Officers of the Mint continued, And therefore no alteration can be made in our Coyn, without breaking the Vnion. To this is its answer'd, That it is certain, there is such a Clause, But 'tis as certain, that no more could be intended thereby, than that the standard and value of the Money of England and Scotland shall be always the same, For, that very clause, After having said that, says Subject to such Regulations & Alterations, as her Majesty, her heirs or successors, or the Parliament of Great-Britain, shall think fit; And indeed were the Standard of our Coyn so fixt by the Vnion, That it could not be alter'd, even by a British-Parliament, we might soon happen to be in very distress'd circumstances indeed; For, if any of our Neighbours should have a mind to ruin us, by drawing away our Gold-Coyn, as others have done our Silver, they have no more to do, but to make their Mints considerably the best Market for Gold, And we shall soon miss our Guineas, as much as we now miss our Crowns and Half Crowns, And then all manner of business would be at a full-stop for want of Money to carry it on. It is said, a Proposal will be made to the House, to lower the price of our Guineas, in order to bring Silver to the Mint. If that Project be well consider'd, It will be found, not altogether insufficient, but of very dangerous consequences, and must doubtless be opposed 
        
         <588v> 
        
        by every one, that has any regard to the true interest of his King and Countrey. Nothing is more evident, Than that all sorts of Goods will find their way to the best Market. That it is not in the power of the Parliament of Great-Britain to alter the prices of Gold & Silver in Foreign-Markets, though they may do it in their own. That while we put no value upon the Coinage, Money is no more than a Commodity. What when we undervalue Gold or Silver in our Coyn, by rating it lower than it is in Bullion (as it is already in our Silver) It it a good Commodity to the Melters & exporters. But not one ounce will be brought to the Mint by any person whatever, that can help it, and that knows what he do's. That the price of Gold in Bullion here of 22 Karrats fine, is a very small matter under 4li an Ounce to the Seller, and as much above 4li. to the Buyer, And that it is but very little less in Holland. That the lowering the price of Guineas, will make it an advantage to everybody to melt down, and export them as they do now our Silver-Coyn, For, so much as Gold or Silver in our Coyn is lower than either our own or our Neighbours Market, so much as the difference is, so much every one will get, by melting down or exporting our Money, For instance, Silver in our Coyn is a penny less at home, & 2d. less abroad than Bullion, & so much is got by melting or exporting it. Therefore we are so far from having it brought to the Mint, that we cannot keep that we have; And if we lower Guineas to 21s, then, he that melts them, or exports them, may get 2d an ounce by so doing; but that will not bring one ounce of Silver to our Mints, Because there will still be but 5s. 2d an ounce given for it, and the Markets at home and abroad, will remain as they now are; And can we imagine, any wise man will bring Silver to the Mint, to lose a penny by every ounce he brings, There can be no other reason given why we have Gold voluntarily brought to our Mints, & no Silver, But that the Merchant gains by the one, & loses by the other, & if Guineas are lower'd, he will gain by neither, and then the Mints must stand still. The lowering the price of Guineas, will not only make them find their way to a better Market, But be a very great loss to his Majesty, to the Bank, and to every one that has Guineas who 
         < insertion from the left margin > took them all at 21s & 6d, & expects to pay them away so; & if they are lower'd, abundance of private men that lose so much of their property, will make themselves whole immediately by melting or exporting them, & it will become a very profitable Trade, to those who regard nothing but their own private advantage, as long as there are any Guineas to Melt or export. < text from f 588v resumes > "

August 1717.,NA,English,MINT00647,Response to a memorandum from Nicholson and Briggs.,"To the Right Honourable the Lord Commissioners of his 
        Majestys Treasury.  May it please your Lordships  In answer to the Memorial of Mr Nicholson & Mr
Briggs, I humbly represent that as often as they have applied themselves 
        to me I have told them that without a Warrant from the King I could 
        not receive copper in blanks, nor coine money with round edges for the 
        people, & that without your Lordships Warrant I could not deliver 
        Cutters to them. I have told them also that Mr Appleby &
Mr Hines since the 3d of Iune last as is pretended, tho I have a Warrant to justify me; nor are they contractors but at discretion; nor have there been any delays but for want of Warrants which the Memorialists should have procured. But if the Memorialists instead of applying for Warrants, have given themselves a great deal of trouble in solliciting me to act without any; if  before they had cutters to direct them in the measure of their work & in opposition to the notice which I gave them that Appleby & Hines being first ready should 
        have the first triall, they have built furnaces & prepared a sufficient 
        quantity of copper ready for the Cutters & been at sufficient charges 
        in preparing the same: they have done this contrary to my advice 
        & without staying for sufficient authority or  knowing how to size their work, & can blame no body but 
        themselves if they should lose their charges for acting in this manner.  The nature of coinage is such that amongst the moneys newly coined there will be some pieces faulty in form. It always was & always will be so in the coinage of gold & silver, & the coinage of fine copper is more difficult. But it is the duty of the Moneyers to pick out the faulty pieces, & I have caused have a Tonn of such faulty copper moneys to be melted down again. 
            
            And if any faulty pieces escape we change them  they are brought back to us & coin them  again. And this has been the standing practise of the Mint {time} out {illeg} without any dispargement to the coinage. Tis the moneyers fault if too many of the pieces escape &  they promis {me} to be careful in this matter.
                Because I am accountable for the gold & silver moneys in weight & fineness, that coinage is performed by people under my direction.
            But if Appleby & Hines be used too hardly no body else will serve me.  This coinage is upon such a foot that I can get nothing but discredit by coining the moneys ill. The assays of Copper are not so exact as those of gold & silver & I am not so well guarded against abuses.
            And his Majestys Warrant has made me accountable also for the value of the copper moneys according to the Rules prescribed therein.
            Therefor I cannot undertake absolutely that in the copper imported there shall be no faulty barrs which may escape the assays, but I am safest in people  whom I can punish by turning them away. Which I shall not be able to do if those that have served me be used too hardly so that no nobody else will serve me. 
            ③
            To coin money of fine copper is a manunufacture never before set up in England, & I have met with  difficulties in setting it up for want of time to try experiments & settle things in the best manner   before I began. For removing the main difficulties I perswaded Mr Hines & Mr Appleby to rent a water Mill, a horse Mill being  found too weak, 
            
            And instead of nealing & cleaning the barrs the Moneyers are now trying if they can learn too  cleans the blanks after nealing. And if the Refiner can but  learn to keep the fumes of the sea-coal from his copper the difficulties will be over.
            
            In the mean time, as I have brought the sizing of the gold & silver moneys to a much greater degree of exactness then ever was known before & thereby saved some thousands of pounds to the government,  & {I am} not blameable for any accidental errors within the remedy of those moneys & have found out a new assay for the copper: so I hope that I shall not be blamed for such errors in the assays of copper as are only accidental

{&} do not exceed in value the remedy allowed in weight, especially while I am endeavouring to set up this coinage in the best manner. If any man  can help me to better assay I am ready to receive them. If he  pretends that I do not keep up my assays, I am willing it should be referred to a trial.  I he  pretends to help me to finer copper without proposing better assays, he offers  nothing but words & deserves not to be regarded. If he pretends to mend the form of the moneys, this is the Moneeyers business & I'l endeavour that  they do it well. If he complains of the faulty pieces which escape the moneyers, he may have been changed at the Mint & I'l  charge the Moneyers to be as carefull as they can in not letting such pieces escape. All which is If any man hath a mind to contract with your Lordships to coyn the money without a assay, I do not oppose it. If he complains that the blanks  crack a little on the edges, he complains
         
        that the Assay established by the Kings Warrant is not good enough to exclude fine copper touched a little with the fumes of the sea coale tho it be better to have this Assay then none at all. If he can tell me to  better assays I am ready to receive them. If he pretend If any man would have the copper nealed & cleaned  in the blanks rather then in the barrs, I am trying which is the better way. If he complains that  some pieces of the money have formerly had great cracks on the edges that accident is long since removed by using a water mill. If he complains that some of the blanks in coining still crack a little on the edges, he complains that the Assay established upon the Kings Warrant is not good enough to exclude fine copper touched a little with the fumes of sea-coale, tho this Assay is better then none at all. If he can help me to better Assays I am ready to receive them. If he pretends that I do not keep to my Assay, I am willing it should be referred to a trial of the moneys coined. If he pretends to help me to finer copper without proposing better Assays, he offers nothing but words & deserves not to be regarded. If he  pretends to mend the form of  the moneys, that is the Moneyers buisiness & I'l endeavour that they do it well. If he complains of the faulty pieces which escape the Moneyers, he may have them changed at the Mint, & In the mean time it may be observed that⑥ when this coinage was set on foot, it was  recconed  better way to  neale & clean the copper in the barrs then in the blanks, that the persons hitherto complaining have wanted to be imployed,② that they have not been able to discover any fraud in the management nor to help me to better assays,③ that  no defect has hitherto been discovered in the moneys which exceed the Remedy,⑤ that the government pays no more for the moneys now coined they  she did for those in the reign of King Wm & yet the copper & workmanship is much better & within these seven years the price of copper is risen 3d per pound weight, &④ that the competition at present is really between the Memorialists & the Moneyers. ⑥  that when this coinage was  set on foot it was recconed better to neale & clean the copper in the barrs then in the blanks, but I am now reconsidering that matter.⑥ & that the melting down of the money for an Assay alters the goodness of the Copper, & thereby makes the Assay uncertain 38 that their proposals have tended either to lay aside the Assays or to weak them.      that"

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference on the Proposals for importing barrs of fine copper into his Majestys Mint for coyning copper money out of them, We humbly represent that upon giving the Proposers a meeting, We find that the Mint may be supplied with such barrs at nineteen pence per pound weight Averdupois or a little under, taking  back the scissel at the same price but scarce under eighteen pence. The Master & Worker is willing to undertake the coynage out of such barrs at three pence farthing per pound weight & to defray all incident charges of assaying weighing coynage & putting off after a Mint is set up. And so a pound weight of Copper with the coinage will cost about 2114d or 2214 & may be cut into 23 or 24 pence to answer all other charges. If there be a King's Clerk, he & the Auditor of this Mint may be paid what your Lordships shall order out of the profits of the coinage. The Master & Worker proposes to pay half the price of the Copper upon the importation thereof. When by publick notice we gave the Proposers a meeting some of them upon hearing how the copper was to be sized & assayed, withdrew. Mr Neale & Partners were in the country & are not yet returned to town. Mr Essington demanded 19d per pound weight for the best copper & 18d for a coarser sort. Mr Iones demanded 1812d for the best copper. Mr Hind demanded 18d. The copper he shewed us was very good & bore the Assay, & this morning he has delivered in some Barrs to be further examined. We are best satisfied with his Proposal, but have not yet had time to examin his barrs. Mr Parker demands the same price, but we have not yet seen his workmanship. If at any time it be thought fit to change the Reverse of the money it may be done by a Signe Manual, paying the Graver for a new Puncheon All which &c Ri. Sandford Is. Newton"

May it please Your Lordships  In obedience to Your Lordship's 
        Order of Reference of the 12th August 1717, that I 
        should lay before Your Lordships, a State of the 
        Gold and Silver Coyns of this Kingdom, in Weight 
        and fineness, and the value of Gold in proportion to 
        Silver, with my observations and Opinion & what 
        Method may be most Effectual for preventing the 
        melting down or exporting the Silver Coyne: I 
        humbly represent to Your Lordships, that a Pound 
        Weight Troy of Gold Eleven Ounces fine & one 
        Ounce allay, is cut into 4412 Guineas, and a 
        Pound Weight of Silver Eleven Ounces two penny 
        Weight fine, and 18 penny weights Allay is cut 
        into 62 shillings, and according to this Rate, 
        a Pound Weight of fine Gold is worth fifteen 
        Pounds Weight Six Ounces, seventeen Penny 
        Weights and five Grains of fine Silver, recconing 
        a Guinea at £1: 1s: 6d in Silver Mony, but 
        Silver in Bullion is usually worth 2d or 3d per 
        
         <111v> 
        
        Ounce more than in Coyne, and if at a medium 
        Such Bullion of Standard Allay, be valued at 5s: 
        4d12 per ounce, a Pound Weight of fine Gold will 
        be worth but 14llwt:– 11oz.:– 12dwt– 9grs::– of fine Silver in Bullion, And at this rate a Guinea is but worth so 
        much Silver as would make 20s: & 8d. When ships 
        are Loading for the East Indies the Demand of Silver for Exportation raises the Price to 5s– 6d. or 5s– 8d. per Ounce, or Above, but I consider not those extraordinary Cases. A Spanish Pistole was coyned for 32 Ryales, 
        or four Pieces of Eight, Rialls commonly called 
        Pieces of Eight, and is of equall Allay, and the 
        Sixteenth Part of the Weight thereof, And a Doppio Moeda of Portugal was coyned for ten Crusados of Silver and is of Equal Allay, and the sixteenth 
        Part of the Weight thereof. Gold is therefore 
        in Spain and Portugal of 16 times more value 
        than Silver of equal weight, and Allay, according to their Standard, At which Rate a Guinea 
        is worth 22s: 1d: But this high Price keeps 
        their Gold at Home, and carrys away their 
        Silver into all Europe, So that at Home they 
        make their Payments in Gold, & will not pay 
        in Silver without a Premium. Vpon the 
        
         <112r> 
        
        Coming in of a Plate Fleet, the Premium ceases 
        or is but small, but as their Silver goes away 
        and becomes scarce, the Premium encreases, & 
        is most commonly about Six per Cent, which being 
        abated a Guinea becomes worth about 20s: and 
        9d in Spain and Portugal. In France a Pound Weight of fine Gold is 
        reckoned worth fifteen Pound Weight of fine 
        Silver. In raising or falling their Mony through 
        King's Edicts, have sometimes varyed a little 
        from this Proportion in Excess or defect; but the 
        Variations have been so little; I do not here 
        consider them. By the Edict of May 1709 
        a new Pistole was coyned for four new Lewises, 
        & is of equal Allay, & the fifteenth part of the 
        Weight thereof, except the Errors of their 
        Mints. And by the same Edict, fine Gold is 
        Valued at 15 times its weight of fine Silver, 
        and at this Rate a Guinea is worth 20s: and 
        8d12. I Consider not here the Confusion made 
        in the Monys in France; by frequent Edicts to 
        send them to the Mint, to give the King a Tax 
        out of them, I consider onely the Value of Gold 
        and Silver in proportion to  one another. The Ducats of Holland 
        
         <112v> 
        
        Hungary and the Empire were lately Current in 
        Holland among the common People in their 
        Markets and Ordinary Affairs at five Guilders 
        in Specie and five Stivers, and commonly changed for so much Silver mony in three Guilder 
        Pieces, and Guilder Pieces as Guineas are changed 
        with us for 21s– 6d sterling, at which rate a Guinea 
        is worth 20s: 7d12. According to the Rates of Gold to Silver in 
        Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark & Sueden 
        a Guinea is worth about 20s: & 7d: 6d: 5d: or 4d. for 
        the Proportion varys a little in the severall Governments within those Countrys. In Swedenland, Gold is lowest in Proportion 
        to Silver, and this has made that Kingdom 
        which formerly was content with Copper 
        Mony, abound of late with Silver; sent thither 
        (I suspect) for Naval Stores. In the End of King William's Reigne 
        and the first Year of the late Queen's, when 
        Forreigne Coins abounded in England, I caused, 
        a great many of them to be Assayed in the 
        Mint, and found by the Assays that fine Gold 
        was to fine Silver in Spain Portugal France 
        Holland Italy Germany and the 
        
         <113r> 
        
        Northern Kingdoms in the Proportions abovementioned, the Errors of the Mints excepted. In China and Iapan One Pound weight 
        of fine Gold is worth but nine or ten pounds 
        of fine Silver and in East India it is worth about 
        twelve, And this low price of Gold in proportion 
        to Silver carryes the silver away from all Europe, and when Ships are loading for the East Indies, raises the Price of Sivler in Bullion to 2d– 3d– or 4d per Ounce above the Ordinary Price as often as Ships are loading for the East Indias It is the demand for Exportation which 
        hath raised the Prices of Exportable Silver about 
        2d or 3d in the Ounce above that of Silver in Coyne 
        and hath thereby created a Temptation to Export 
        or Melt downe the Silver Coyne rather than give 
        2d or 3d. more for Forreign Silver, And the 
        Demand for Exportation arises from the higher 
        Value of Silver in other Places than in England 
        in proportion to Gold, that is from the higher value of Gold in England than in other Places in 
        Proportion to Silver.— If Gold could be brought
        down so low in England or Silver in East India
        as to bear the same Proportion to one another 
        in both Places, there would be no greater 
        
         <113v> 
        
        Demand for Silver then for Gold to be exported 
        to India, And if Gold were brought downe to
        have the same Proportion to the Silver Mony in England, which it hath to it in the rest of Europe, 
        there would be no Temptation to Export Silver 
        rather than Gold to any other part of Europe. 
        And to Compass this last there seems nothing 
        more requisite than to take off about 10d or 12d
from the Price  of the Guinea; But if 
        onely six pence were taken off at Present it
        wou'd diminish the Temptation to Export or 
        Melt down the Silver Coyne, and the Effect wou'd 
        shew hereafter, better than it can appear at
        Present with further Reduction would be most
        convenient for the Publick. Those that import Gold represent that their Profit is but small, & if by Lowering the Price that Profit be taken away, these will be neither Gold nor Silver imported: But must the Nation pay 38 or 40 shillings too much for every Pound Weight of Gold imported? Must all Our Silver be Exported to enrich the Merchants and is there no remedy? In the last Year 
        
         <114r> 
{of} King William's Reigne the Dollars of Scotland 
        worth about four Shillings and Six pence 
        halfpenny, were put away in the North of 
        England for five Shillings, and at this Price 
        began to flow in upon us: I gave Notice thereof 
        to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and 
        they Ordered the Receivers of Taxes to forbear 
        taking them at that Value, & thereby put 
        a Stop to the Mischief. At the same time the Lewis d'ores of 
        France which were worth but seventeen shillings and three farthings a piece, passed in 
        England at Seventeen and Six pence, I gave Notice thereof to the Commissioner of the Treasury, & his late Majesty put out a Proclamation 
        that they should go but at 17 Shillings, & 
        thereupon, they came to the Mint and a Million 
        and four hundred thousand Pounds were 
        coyned out of them, and if the Advantage of 
        five pence farthing in a Lewis d'ore sufficed at 
        that time to bring into England so great a 
        Quantity of French Mony, and the Advantage of three Farthings in a Lewis d'ore to 
        bring it to the Mint, the Advantage of 
        
         <114v> 
        
        Nine Pence halfpenny or above may have 
        been sufficient to bring in the great Quantity of Gold which has been Coined in these 
        last 16 Years without any Forreign Silver. Some Years ago the Portugal Moyders, were received in the West of England 
        at 28s a piece, Vpon Notice from the Mint that
        they were worth onely about 27s & 7d: the 
        Lords Commissioners of the Treasury order'd their Receivers of Taxes to take them for no more 
        than 27s & 6d. Afterwards many Gentlemen 
        in the West Sent Vp to the Treasury a Petition, that the Receivers might take them 
        again, at 28 Shillings, and Promised to get 
        Returns for this Mony at that Rate, alledging 
        that when they went at 28s, their Country was 
        full of Gold, which they wanted very much: 
        But the Commissioners of the Treasury considering that 
        at 28s the Nation would loose five pence a piece 
        rejected their Petition. And if an Advantage 
        to the Merchant of 5d in 28s: did pour that 
        Mony in upon Vs, much more hath the
        Advantage to the Merchant of 9d12 or 10d: in a 
        Guinea been able to bring to the Mint 
        
         <115r> 
        
        Mint great Quantitys of Gold without any Forreigne Silver and may be able to do it till the 
        Cause be removed. If things be let alone till Silver Mony 
        be a little Scarcer the Gold will fall of it selfe, 
        for People are allready backward in giving 
        Silver for Gold, and will in a little time refuse 
        to make Payments in Silver without a Premium, 
        And this Premium will be an Abatement in 
        the Value of the Gold, and so the Question is 
        whether Gold shall be lowered by the Government or let alone till it falls of it selfe for 
        the Want of Silver Monys. It may be said that there are great 
        Quantitys of Silver in Plate; and if the Plate 
        were Coyned, there would be no want of Silver 
        Mony, But I Reckon that Silver is Safer from 
        Exportation in the Form of Plate than in 
        the Forme of Mony, because of the greater 
        Value of the Silver and Fashion together, 
        and therefore I am not for Coyning the Plate 
        till the Temptation to Exporting the Silver 
        mony, (which is a Profit of 2d. or 3d. in the ounce) 
        be taken away; For as often as men are 
        
         <115v> 
        
        necessitated to Send away Mony for answering Debts abroad, they will be tempted to send away Silver rather than 
        Gold, because of the Profit which is allmost four per Cent and for the same reason Forreigners 
        will send hither their Gold rather than their 
        Silver. All which is most humbly submitted to Your Lordship's Great Wisdom  Isaac Newton Memoriall about the high Values of Gold.—"
781,782.,Letter concerning the state of the gold and silver coins,"21 Sep 1717, c. 1,981 words",http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/MINT01000,NA,"1,981 words",21 Sep 1717,NA,English,MINT01000,Letter concerning the state of the gold and silver coins,"To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury  May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of Aug. 12th, that I should lay before your Lordships a State of the Gold & Silver Coyns of this Kingdom  in weight & fineness, & the value of gold in proportion to silver with my observations & opinion, & what method may be best for preventing the melting down of the silver coyn: I humbly represent that a pound weight Troy of Gold eleven ounces fine & one ounce allay is cut into 4412 Guineas, & a pound weight of silver eleven ounces two penny weight fine & eighteen penny weight allay is cut into 62 shillings; & according to this rate, a pound weight of fine gold is worth fifteen pounds weight six ounces seventeen penny weight & five grains of fine silver, recconing a Guinea at 1li 1s 6d in silver money.  But silver in Bullion exportable is usually worth 2d or 3d per ounce more then in coyn. And if at a Medium such bullion of standard allay be valued at 5s 4d12 per ounce, a pound weight of fine Gold will be worth but 14lwt. 11oz 12dwt. 9grs of fine silver in bullion. And at this rate a Guinea is worth but so much silver as would make 20s 8d. When ships are lading for the East Indies the demand of silver for exportation raises the price to 5s 6d or 5s 8d per ounce or above{: but} I consider not those extraordinary cases. A Spanish Pistole was coyned for 32 Reaus or four pieces of eight Reaus usually called pieces of eight, & is of equal allay & the sixteenth part of the weight thereof. And a Doppio Moeda of Portugal was coyned for ten Crusados of  silver & is of equal allay & the sixteenth part of the weight thereof. Gold is therefore in Spain & Portugal of sixteen times more value then silver of equal weight & allay according to the standard of those kingdoms. At which rate a Guinea is worth 22s 1d. But this high price keeps their gold at home in good plenty & carries away the Spanish silver into all Europe, so that at home they make their payments in Gold & will not pay in silver without a premium. Vpon the coming in of a Plate fleet, the premium ceases or is but small: but as their silver goes away & becomes scarce, the premium increases, & is most commonly about six per cent. Which being abated a Guinea becomes worth about 20s & 9d in Spain & Portugal. In France a pound weight of fine gold is recconed worth fifteen pounds weight of fine silver. In raising or falling their money, their king's Edicts have sometimes varied a little from this proportion in excess or defect: but the variations have been so little that I do not here consider them{.} By the Edict of May 1709 a new Pistole was coyned for four new Lewises & is of equal allay & the fifteenth part of the weight thereof except the errors of their Mints. And by the same Edict fine Gold is valued at fifteen times its weight of fine silver. And at this rate a Guinea is worth 20s 8d12. I consider not here the confusion made in the monies in France by Frequent Edicts to send them to the Mint & give the king a Tax out of them. I consider only the value of Gold & Silver in proportion to 
                    
                     <204v> 
                    
                    one another. The Ducats of Holland & Hungary & the Empire were lately current in Holland among the common people in their Markets & ordinary affairs at five Guilders in specie & five styvers, & commonly changed for so much silver moneys in three Guilder pieces, & Guilder pieces as Guineas are with us for 21s 6d sterling. At which rate a Guinea is worth 20s 7d12. According to the rates of Gold to Silver in Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark & Sueden a Guinea is worth about 20s & 7d, 6d, 5d or 4d. For the proportion varies a little within the several governments in those countries. In Sueden Gold is lowest in proportion to silver, & this hath made that kingdom which formerly was content with copper money abound of late with silver sent thither (I suspect) for naval stores. In the end of King Williams reign & the {fir}st year of the late Quee{n} when foreign coyns abounded in England, I caused a great many of them to be assayed in the Mint & found by the assays that fine Gold was to fine silver in Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, Italy, Germany, & the northern kingdoms, in the proportions above mentioned, errors of the Mints excepted. In China and Iapan one pound weight of fine gold is worth but nine or ten pounds weight of fine silver; & in East India it may be worth twelve. And this low price of gold in proportion to silver, carries away the silver from all Europe. So then by the course of trade & Exchange between nation & natio{n} in all Europe, fine gold is to fine silver as 1445 or 15 to one. And a Guinea at the same rate is worth between 20s 5d & 20s 8d12, except in extraordinary cases, as when a Plate Fleet is just arrived in Spain, or ships are lading here for the East Indies, which cases I do not here consider. And it appears by  experience as well as by reason that silver flows from those places where its value is lower in proportion to gold, as from Spain to all Europe & from all Europe to the East Indies China & Iapan, & that Gold is most plentifull in those places in which its value is highest in proportion to silver, as in Spain & England. It is the demand for exportation which hath raised the price of exportable silver about 2d or 3d in the ounce above that of silver in coyn, & hath thereby created a temptation to export or melt down the silver coyn rather then give 2d or 3d for forreign silver And the demand for exportation arises from the higher price of silver in other places then in England in proportion to gold, that is, from the higher price of gold in England then in other places in proportion to silver; & therefore may be diminished by lowering the value of gold in proportion to silver. If gold in England or Silver in East India could be brought down so low as to bear the same proportion to one another in both places, there would be here no greater demand for silver then for gold to be exported to India. And if Gold were lowered only so as to have the same proportion to the silver money in England which it hath to silver in the rest of Europe, there would be no temptation to export silver rather then Gold to any other part of Europe. And to compass this last there seems nothing more requisite then to take off about 10d or 12d from the Guinea, so that Gold may beare the same proportion to the silver money in England which it ought to do by the course of Trade & Exchange in Europe. But if only 6d were taken off at present, it would diminish the temptation to export or melt down the silver coyn, & by the effects would shew hereafter better then can appear at present, what further reduction would be most convenient for the publick. In the last year of K. William, the Dollars of Scotland worth about four shillings & six pence half penny, were put away in the north of England {for} 5s, & at this price began to flow in upon us. I gave notice thereof to {t}he Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, & they ordered the Collectors of Taxes 
                    
                     <205r> 
                    
                    to forbear taking them & thereby put a stop to the mischief. At the same time the Lewidors of France which were worth but seventeen shillings & three farthings a piece passed in England at 17s 6d. I gave notice thereof to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury & his late Majesty put out a proclamation that they should go but at 17s, & thereupon they came to the mint & fourteen hundred thousand pounds were coyned out of them. And if the advantage of five pence farthing in a Lewidor sufficed at that time to bring into England so great a quantity of French money, & the advantage of three farthings in a Lewidor to bring it to the Mint: the advantage of 912d in a  Guinea or above may have been sufficient to bring in the great quantity of gold which hath been coined in these last fifteen years without any forreign silver. Some years ago the Portugal Moedors were received in the west of England at 28s a piece. Vpon notice from the Mint that they were worth only about 27s 7d, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury ordered their Receivers of Taxes to take them at no more than 27s 6d. Afterwards many Gentlemen in the West sent up to the Treasury a Petition that the Receivers might take them again at 28s, & promised to  get returns for this money at that rate, alledging that when they went at 28s their country was full of gold which they wanted very much. But the Commissioners of the Treasury considering that at 28s the nation would lose five pence a piece, rejected the Petition. And if an advantage to the Merchant of 5d in 28s did pour that money in upon us: much more hath an advantage to the Merchant of 912d in a Guinea or above, been able to bring into the Mint great quantities of gold without any forreign silver, & may be able to do it still till the cause be removed. If things be let alone till silver money be a little scarcer, the Gold will fall of it self. For people are already backward to give silver for Gold, and will in a little time refuse to make payments in silver without a premium as they do in Spain, & this premium will be an abatement in the value of the gold. And so the Question is {whe}ther Go{ld} shall be l{ow}ered by the government, or let alone till it falls of it self by the {want} of silver money. It may be said that there are great quantities of silver in Plate, & if the Plate were coyned there would be no want of silver money. But I reccon that silver is safer from exportation in the form of Plate then in the form of money because of the greater value of the silver & fashion together. And therefore I am not for coyning the Plate till the temptation to export the silver money (which is a profit of 2d or 3d an ounce) be diminished. For as often as men are necessitated to send away money for answering debts abroad, there will be a temptation to send away silver rather then Gold because of the profit which is almost 4 per cent. And for the same reason, forreigners will chuse to send hither their gold rather then their silver.  All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome Isaac Newton. 12.

You are an able Iudge of these matters, and your opinion of all of them, will oblige a great many people, but I being wholly unknown to you, I cannot desire it otherwise, than in the way (which was in print) that your Representation came to the hands of Sir Your most humble Servant M M."

And  in refining it, so soon as it begins to spread under the hammer when made red hot, it  begins to be called fine copper, & then it is worth about 13d per poundweight, & when it is fine enough to beare the  great hammers of the battering mills, it is reputed  fine copper  free from all mixtures & is then valued at about 14d12 per poundweight. And of about this degree of fineness  was the copper money coined in the reign of King Charles II,  it being of Swedish copper manufactured into blanks in Sweden. And of  about the same degree of fineness  is all such copper as being made red hot will then spread very thin under the  hand hammer upon an anvill without cracking And by his Majesties Warrant the money ought to be of this degree of fineness Copper may be refined to a much higher degree so as to be worth 2s or 2s 6d per poundweight or above. But such copper is of little use except for making wire or leafe copper/ & there is no certain assay or rule yet known by which the fineness of it may be  ascertained & the highest degre to which it may be refined is not yet known   There have been blanks made of much fined copper then the money by people not imployed by me & stamped in the Mint without my knowledge & then polished to give them a more beautifull gloss & shewn about to deceive people & bring the money into discredit, & brockage hath also been picked out of the money & shewn about a parcel of money received from the Mint, & there may have been blanks of  coarse copper carried to the Mint & there stamped without my knowledge, or otherwise counterfeited, & mixed with the brockage. The goodnes of copper cannot be known by the looks alone. It must be assayed.  By the colour & grain of the copper when it is newly broken some judgment may be made by a skilful person: but the surest trial is by the malleability of the copper hot & cold. And therefore this was made the assay of standard copper by his Majestys Warrant, & by this assay the Pix  of what has been coined is to be tried. "

Clark, Mr Iohn Essington, Mr Henry Robinson, Collonel Par{k}er Mr Richard Iones above mentioned, Mr Wood, Mr Holloway & Mr Pye, several of whom proposed that the farthings & Halfe pence coined in King Charles time should be the standard of the metal & that in six months time there has been but three tons of copper delivered into the Mint tho the people are in great want of Copper money: in answer to all this {it} is represented that  the Copper money coined in the reign of King Charles was of Swedish Copper manufactured into blanks in Swedeland where  the copper & workmanship is cheaper then in England, that no finer Copper was proposed by any of the persons above mentioned then that which  will spread red hot under the great hammers of the battering mills till it be as thin as the half pence & farthings & that such copper is accounted as fine as King Charles's money, that the copper  now brought into the Mint is assayed by  battering it both red hot & cold till it be as thin as paper, & no better assay can be had in the Mint. that Copper which beares this assay is not inferior to the Copper which beares the assay of the battering Mill or not above a farthing in the {pou}nd weight inferior to it, that  the working of Copper into barrs of due size & fineness for making of money is manufacture  <352v> not yet practised in England &  therefore not yet ripe for a contract  that Mr Chambers, Mr Essington & Mr Robinson & (I think) Mr Clark are partners & some of them proposed to do it by the battering mills first at 22 34d & afterwards at 19d per Lwt, Mr Holloway proposed to do it by the battering mill at  a rate amounting  to about 19d per Lwt & Mr Jones at 1812d.  Those that now supply the Mint with copper do it at 18d per poundweight.  Mr Pye   in the name of Mr Neale Marchant & Company proposed to deliver copper in barrs which would stand the assay  at 1712d, but could not under take the flatting & drawing thru the mill to a proper size,  & nealing & scouring at that rate. Mr Wood  proposed to deliver Plates of fine rolled Copper fit for the Mint at {17}d12 per poundweight but being absent in the country his son appeared for him  at the Mint & went away again without speaking with the officers of the Mint about his fathers Proposal. Mr Parker is partnered with Mr Wood & these two  have  not since offered to be imployed without entring into a contrac{t.}  The persons now imploying do not act upon a contract. They are only upon tryal, & if they do not make good their Proposals, they may be laid aside at any time.  To make the Embosments & Puncheons & take off some Dyes from them was a work of four months or above.  Since that time they have begun to bring Copper into the Mint & have made trials of several methods of manufacturing it, & are still making further trials, & if it had not been for the importunity of the people, no money would have been delivered till these trials had been over & the best method fixed upon. And now if any of the Petitioners or any other worker in Copper will for a trial furnish the Mint with a Ton or two of Copper monthly  well sized & scoured & which shall beare the assay  now used in the Mint  at 18d per poundweight or under, he shall meet with encouragement suitable to the goodness of the workmanship & the lowness of the price. But it is not reasonable that the persons whose Proposals have been rejected should be  witnesses in their own cause.  that the Proposers here mentioned  cannot be  witnesses in their own cause but recourse must be had to the assays  of the copper — that within these five years copper is risen 3d in the pound weight & the manufacture is now dearer in England then 40 years ago in Swedeland & yeta pound weight  which in the reign of King Charles was cut into 20d is now cut into no more then 23d  ."

The salaries of the Officers of the Mint in Scotland amount only to 980li per annum whereof 50li per annum is to cease at the death of the late Clerk of the bullion, & the charge of keeping the Offices in repair & the dwelling houses of the Officers wind & water tite, can be but small; & therefore twelve hundred pounds per annum allowed to that Mint hitherto without including the charge of coinage, is too much. If to the 1200li allready in their hands for one year, the summ of 1800li more be added to make up the whole summ 3000li for the three years ending at Christmas last, & the 1800li be imprest for the use & service of that Mint in general, so that it may be applicable to all sorts of charges, & the Account be made up to Christmas last, the Ballance of the Account may be then certified to your Lordships in order to be considered when the next moneys shall be imprest. And so on from time to time. And considering that the Indenture of that Mint doth not impower the General to pay any moneys, I am humbly of opinion that there should be a Signe Manual sent to him impowering & 
    
     <108r> 
    
    directing him to pay the Salaries & other expences to whom they shall become due by the said Indenture, & to make up his Accounts annually, & directing him & all the Officers in their several stations to take care that the moneys be duly coined, & to observe all the Rules & Precepts set down in the said Indenture (except the alterations made by Parliament,) untill a new Indenture shall be made. And that there may be no more complaints of the want of moneys to beare the charge of coinage, the said General may have notice to pay those charges in the first place, & let the deficiency (whenever there shall be any) fall upon the Salaries. All which is most humbly submitted to Your Lordships great wisdome Isaac Newton."

Observation 1. Standard Gold before sixpence was taken from the Guinea was worth 3li. 19s. 9d14 per ounce at the Mint, & by taking six pence from the Guinea became worth 3li 17s 11d per ounce. And standard silver is there worth 5s 2d per ounce. But the demand for exportation hath raised both species above the price at the Mint, & thereby hath carried out all the forreign silver for many years, & began to carry out some of the forreign gold the last November, & therefore raised the price of gold for exportation above the Mint price before the sixpence was taken from the Guinea. But it never raised it to more then 4li. 0s. 6d per ounce, not kept it long at that price. For in March last, forreign gold fell down below the old Mint price, & hath ever since continued below it, being at 3li. 19s. 6d & for the most part at 3li. 19s. 0d & under. And therefore the price of forreign Gold for exportation was  raised the last winter by some other cause then the taking sixpence from the Guinea. And the price of Gold for exportation to forreign markets having been ever since March below the old Mint-price, that price was certainly too high. Observation 2. The price of gold for exportation depends upon the price in forreign markets & answers to the course of exchange. When the Exchange is lowest the price of forreign gold is highest & on the contrary. And thence the coinage of gold hath of late years been greater or less accordingly as the course of Exchange hath been higher or lower. In the year 1713 the course of Exchange & the coinage grew high together. In the years 1714 & 1715 the Exchange was highest, it being (for instance) with Amsterdam from 36 to 37 skillings, & then the coinage was greatest. In the year 1716 the Exchange was only from 35 to 36 skillings with Amsterdam & proportionally with other places, & the coinage abated accordingly. In the year 1717 the Exchange with Amsterdam was only from 34 to 35.2, & the coinage abated to one half of what it had been two or three years before. And in this present year the exchange has been only from 33.10 to 34.10 till within this fortnight; & this low course of Exchange together with the discouragement of the coinage of gold by the taking sixpence from the Guinea, hath carried out almost all the Gold imported & thereby hath had the same good effect for paying our debts abroad in gold & preserving our silver, which the Bill proposed the last Sessions of Parliament would have had if it had passed into an Act for stopping the coinage of gold. Whence those debts arose is difficult to understand without more skill in Trade then I can pretend to. But considering that a good part of the Gold imported in the years 1713, 1714, 1715 & 1716 was in French money & Ducats, I suspect that after the war with France was at an end, great quantities of gold were sent hither to pay for stocks untill the interest of stocks was lowered by Act of Parliament: & since that discouragement some forreigners have been drawing their moneys backwith the interest, & some of their stocks & some gold hath this year been sent to the Mints in France. Observation 3. The course of Exchange was as low in November last before the 6d was taken from the Guinea, as it was afterwards in February last; & both times was at the lowest, being (with Amsterdam) at 33.10. And therefore the lowness of the Exchange last winter arose, not from the taking sixpence from the Guinea, but from the debts which we had abroad before the sixpence was taken off. Which debts, if the coinage of gold had not been discouraged by taking 6d from the Guinea, might have remained unpaid till they could have been paid in silver with more advantage to  private persons. Observation 4. By the payment of our debts abroad in Gold the demand for exportation hath abated ever since February last, & the exchange hath risen gradually to 35 skillings {&} gold hath fallen down gradually to the Mint price & begun to come to the Mint again, so that within a fortnight so much gold hath come to the Mint as will make above 75000li. Whence I gather that whenever the Exchange with Amsterdam is above 35 skillings it will bring gold to the Mint & would have brought gold to the Mint in the years 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716 & part of 1717 although the sixpence had been taken off before, the exchange with Amsterdam in all those years being above 35 skillings & for the most part above 36. And therefore in all the gold then coined, which was above five millions, the nation would have saved  six pence per Guinea had the sixpence been taken off before. Observation 5. The demand for exportation hath ever since the sixpence was taken from the Guinea, raised the price of silver about three times more then the price of gold & sometimes four or five times more or above. And therefore the temptation to export gold moneys hath all this year been three times less then the temptation to export silver moneys. And if this temptation hath not this year sensibly diminished the quantity of our silver moneys, it hath  much less carried out our gold moneys: And  all or almost all the gold which hath been exported this year hath been in forreign bullion. And by consequence the nation hath lost little or nothing by the exportation, because the bullion being forreign, went out at the same price that it came in at. Forreigners or their Agents who here receive guineas in payments, will lose above 3d per Guinea by exporting them, besides the danger they run by breaking the Law. Observation 6. Since the demand of silver for exportation hath all this year been three times greater then that of Gold, no gold would have been exported this year had it not been for the want of forreign silver; & the exportation thereof hath prevented the exportation of the same valu{e} of forreign silver as fast as it could have been procured for paying debts abroad, & in the mean time hath saved the interest of the debts paid off. Observation 7. And this expenditure hath been a further advantage to the nation by raising the course of exchange from 33.10 to 35. For when the exchange is low the nation loseth by it so much as it is under the par. And if the debts which have been paid in gold had continued till they could have been paid in silver, they would have caused the exchange to continue low. Observation 8. And to restore the sixpence to the Guinea would be to lose these advantages, & to give more by above ninepence in the Guinea for all the gold which shall be coined hereafter then it is worth in forreign markets, & to revive the corrupt trade of exporting silver to buy gold abroad & importing gold to buy silver at home.

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of 15 Apr. 1719, upon the Memorial of Mr Appl{ebly} & Mr Hines, I have considered the same, & humbly represent that fine copper will not run close into Barrs like Gold Silver & coarse copper, but requires to be either battered or rolled thin by a Mill; & the cheapest way is to roll it. But a horse Mill being too weak & too chargeable for this purpose I advised the said Importers to procure a water Mill. And to encourage them to do it I promised to give them no disturbance my self so long as they kept to their covenants in the copper which they brought to me. But at the same time I told them that I could engage nothing for my superiors. Hereupon they took a water Mill neare Maidenhead bridge three or four miles above Windsor at the rent of 52li per annum for two years and an half from midsummer last, besides a fine of 20 Guineas & 65li paid for Tools left there by Mr Ayres, as I understand by the writings. They took also another little place neare it for a Warehouse & lodging room & for building a Refining furnace, at 12li per annum; & the furnace cost them almost 40li as they inform me{:} besides the charge of Beds & furniture for servants & of new Rolls & iron moulds & boxes for the copper & other utensils amounting to 70li, & besides an hundred load of wood & four load of Charcoal upon their hands for this service. And during the intermission of the coinage they pay 39s per week retaining wages to a Clerk & Refiner & two other servants. When a stop was put to the coinage, I informed your Lordships that 25 Tons of copper money were then coined & delivered, besides what was ready to be delivered of which I did not then know the quantity: but it was just delivered and amounted unto 26 weight. And as much copper was that day brought into the Mint as made 26 more: so that there have been coined 27 Tonns & 12 weight. There was also at that time 25 in Barrs brought down the river ready to be delivered, & 45 at the Mill in pickle & 35 rolled but not cleaned, & 412 rolled hot but not cold; & in Scissel Brockage & Cakes 12812; besides thirty Tons contracted for under hand & seale, as appears to me by the writing. By the Bills of parcells several of which I have seen, the copper hitherto imported cost about 1312d per poundweight & some almost 14d. The Blanks being hardned round the edges by the cutter & not nealed after cutting are apt to crack on the edges in stamping if the copper be not sufficiently fine, & this cracking has been promoted by two parcells of copper bought of Mr Briggs: but these cracks are very small & may be prevented by making the copper a very little finer. The Rolls at first were rough & made the copper rough, which occasioned much complaint in the Mint till within a few days before the coinage was stopt: but the Rolls are now smooth, & the last parcell or two of copper imported was smooth & well cleaned. Considering therefore, the charges that the Importers are & have been at; the quantity of copper upon their hands, some of which is prepared; & the demand of copper money by the people: it seems to me that the 25 of copper barrs brought down the river to be imported when the coinage was stopt, & the 45 then in pickle & now pickled; be forthwith imported, provided the copper beare the assays prescribed; & that the 35 rolled but not yet cleaned be cleaned & imported if your Lordships think fit: the Moneyers being commanded by your Lordships, if you please to pick out all the brockage & blanks from the money. And then the rest of the copper may be prepared & imported, provided the barrs be smooth & cleane & well sized & beare the assays, & the Blanks beare the Press without cracking And in the mean time if any other Proposalls be made to your Lordships for coyning the money better or of better copper by the assay, the same may be compared with what Mr Appleby & Mr Hines will undertake. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome Isaac Newton"

'And his said Majesty doth grant & confirm by these presents that the Officers of the Mint shall  at all times have hold & peacably enjoy all places houses & grounds as well builded as unbuilded within the said Mint which  heretofore have been called reputed or taken for the Mint without the medling let or disturbance by the chief Governour Constable Lieutenant or any other Officer or Minister of the Tower. This grant is of above 160 years standing as I find by copies of old Indentures And no mention being made therein of any Officer of the Ordnance, it seems to have been made before that Office was erected. About the year 1577 a Smith shop in the Mint was put into repair by the Office of Ordnance & may have been since frequently repaired by them. And the same smith has usually (if not always, till of late) been Smith of the Mint, & had a fourge at the end of the Mill-rooms for making Dyes & Puncheons for the Mint When the coinage was set on foot by the Mill & Press (which was in the year 1665,) there was an Order of Council for removing all strangers out of the Mint; but this Smith was not removed: whether because he was Smith to both Offices or for any other reason I do not know. Mr Slingsby about 80 years ago endeavoured to remove this Smith of the Ordnance out of the Mint & for that end a Committee of Council came to the  Tower to view whether another place in the Tower might not be found for him to work in & the further end of the Mint was put into the hands of the Office  of Ordnance & a new gate built for bounding the Mint at that end. And there is a tradition in the Mint that th{e} Office of Ordnance was thereupon to have quitted the Smiths shop. But Mr Slingsby soon after falling into trouble &  in the beginning of the reign of King Iames the Mint being turned into a garrison, the shop continued in the hands of the Office of Ordnance, & about 21 years ago they rebuilt it,  & are now building more houses in the Mint. Wherefore your Memorialist most humbly prays your Excellencies, that the Surveyor of the Ordnance may  desist from building untill the  case be examined & the bounds of the Mint be so  setled  as may prevent these disputes for the future, & render the coinage safe for encouraging Merchants to import their gold & silver, & leave sufficient room for building more Mills & Furnaces when ever it shall be necessary & also for building a house for our Porter, & that the Gates of the Mint may still remain in his custody for the safety of the coinage. Answer The  bounds of the Mint are setled by a covenant under the bread seal above 160 years old, & the smiths shop is within those bounds, the late greatcoinage was not carried on without  what one now want . Our Smith dwell in the Smiths house during the late great coinage  did our busines in & fourge now taken from us & we then used the Irish now not in our custody   The Officers houses in the Mint were built for them to live in & attend the buisiness of the Mint, & if any of those houses stand empty or are let to strangers it is  not because we have too much room but because our Officers have beenn discourged from living in theMint as well by the  noise & smoke of the Smiths four {ges} & the neighbourhood of soldiers &c. And our Engineer which they ca{n} {gun} Master Smith    is very different from  our Smith,  & ought not to be confounded with him. {As} the {gratits} made to Hopkins, Piasso, Tayte, Hodgskins to be Master Smithe of all the Iron works within the Tower of London to hold the same during life a Mansion, {donnbus} proficuis emolumentis  &c do not extend to the buisiness of the Mint, so it is not necessary that they should extend to the houses in the Mint.  Mr Hodgskins & his successor Mr Silverster & the sons of Mr Silverster were Smiths of the  Mint as well as of the Ordnace & their predecessors might be so, For  there is no memory of any other Smiths ship for the Smith of the Mint then this in dispute. This house was repaired in the year 1577 & might be built many before by the Mint for their Smith. For the Mint  had a Smith ever since it was a Mint & by consequence before the Office of Ordnance was erected. And its more probable that that Office at its first erection,  for want of a smiths shop of their own, should make use of the Smith of the Mint for doing their coarse work, then that the Mint should leave their own smith with his shop to make use of the Smith & shop of the Ordnance for making & mending their coining tools. To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury  May it please your Lordships  In answer to the Memorialists"

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to me by Mr Tilson's letter of the 5t Instant, that I should report the value of Imperial Dollars both intrinsecally & by way of Exchange with Sweden: I humbly represent that the specie Rixdollars are coined of several values by several Princes of the Empire from 4s 4d to 4s 8d. But in Books of Exchange the Rix dollar is valued at 48 schellings Lubs of Hamburgh, at 48 styvers of Antwerp, at 50 styvers of Amsterdam & at 4s 6d English{.} There is also a Common Dollar of the Empire in respect of which the Gulde or Guilder is usually marked 23 to signify that it is two thirds of this Dollar. The Gulde us 24 Marien Grosch the Common Dollar 36 Marien Grosh & the Rix dollar two Gulden, so that the common Dollar is three quarters of the Rix Dollar. The difficulty is to know whether by the Imperial Dollar be meant the Common Dollar of the Empire or the Rix Dollar. If any payments have been made to Sweden since the Treaty of 616 Ianuary 1700, the Precedent is to be followed as the best interpreter of the Treaty. If none; I am told that the Imperial Dollar is sometimes taken for the common Dollar but more usually for the Rix Dollar, & that the word Reichs or Rycks Thalere signifies imperial Dollar. But I am not skilled in the German language. In the weekly Tables of Exchange with London, the number set over against Hamburgh signifies the number of Bank schelling and deneirs to be paid or received at Hamburgh [1] for one pound sterling at London: & 359 schellings are at a par with one pound sterling. How the exchange is between London & Stockholm I do not find in the Tables. But by the Treaty the money is to be paid at London to the Order of the Crown of Sweden.

And Iames Hamilton, who had been imployed in smelting the Ore brought some of it to London  in March or April (1716) & made the Lord Maior acquainted with the richness of the Mine, & Mr Haldane the brother in law of Sir Iohn made the matter known at court. 2 It was at first proposed to send down Sir Isaac Newton to examin the Mine, but he represented himself unacquainted with such matters, & declined recommending any body else in point of skill, saying that it would be better to send down somebody of skill from the kings silver Mines in Germany. Whereupon Dr Iustus Brandshagen was proposed by others. 3 And his Royal Highness the Prince (then Regent) signed a Warrant Aug. 20 1716 to the Commissioners of the Treasury directing them to pay or cause to be paid to Iustus Brandshagen 60li & to Iames Hamilton 30li to enable them to go down to Scotland to work or try the working of this Mine, & further to pay or cause to be payd to I. Brandshagen 20s per diem & to Iam. Hamilton 10 s per diem from the day or says they should respectively arrive at Edinburgh for & during their stay in Scotland upon the said work, or so long as the said Commissioners should see cause to pay the said respective allowances to them or either of them in consideration of their or either of their service & application to the said work, & the testimony they should receive thereof. And Brandshagen & Hamilton by an Order from the Treasury dated Aug 27 received their advance money at the Exchequer Aug. 31. 4 The Prince also signed (3d Sept. 1716) a Paper of Instructions to be observed by them in the survey & tryal of the Mine in the presence & with the assistance of Mr Haldane aforesaid, Mr Drummond Warden of his Majestys Mint at Edinburgh & any other persons whom the  Earl of Lauderdale General of the said Mint should send thither, & to make a return  in writing of all their proceedings therin to the Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury with the utmost expedition. In this Paper Iames Hamilton is stiled Assistent to Iustus Brandshagen, & the buisiness of watching the Mine is not among the Instructions. 5 After this, Iames Hamilton knowing his own insufficiency, was averse from going without his brother Tho. Hamilton, & thereby put the government to the expence of 109li to send his brother Thomas down with him. And without Thomas they could not have gone through the business. See Mr Drummonds Letter to Sir I. N. dated Feb. 17 1717. Thomas therefore was promised the same allowance with his brother. And Sir Is. Newton by Order advanced  to him the 30li & by Warrant of the Commissioners of the Treasury dated Sept. 5. 1716 was repaid at the Exchequer. 6 The Hamiltons arrived at Edinburgh Sept. 14 & Brandshagen Octob. 13th. And tho Iames Hamilton had pretended to know the Mine, yet they loitered still at Edinburgh some weeks till Sir Iohn Erskin came down to shew them the Mine. By the Princes directions they were to make hast, & yet they were above five months in Scotland in executing their Commission tho they might have done it in less then half the time. They loitered so much that the Earl of Lauderdale Mr Haldane & Mr Drummond declared themselves ashamed of the delays, as appears by Mr Drummonds aforesaid Letter to Sir I. N. dated Feb. 16  1717. And all this negligence the Commissioners of the Treasury were impowered by the Prince's Warrant to consider. 7 When they had finished the work of surveying the Mine, & were preparing to draw up the Report,  Sir Is. Newton received two Letters dated Ian. 8th & Ian. 24 & signed by the Earl of Lauderdale, Mr Haldane & Mr Drummond  in the first of which they described the form, bigness & richness of the vein of Ore, &  moved that he should
    
     <246v> 
        
        acquaint the Lords of the Treasury that this survey was over & that the Report was preparing: & in the second that every thing was then in readiness & that they intended to have sent up the Report  with the Assays & Ore  by Express that night (Ian 24,) but were stopt by  a sudden resolution of Branshagen & the two Hamiltons (directly contrary to the Princes Order) that the Reports should not come up before them but they would bring it up themselves. And after this they loitered at Edinburgh till Feb. 19 & so put the government to the superfluous charge of 40s per diem for the space of 26 days more, which is as much money as Hamilton now sues for wanting only 10s. 8 In the said second Letter a Question was insinuated whether Brandshagen & the two Hamiltons should all of them leave Edinburgh without order, & Sir I. Newton Ian 31 by Order wrote back that Tho. Hamilton should stay to  watch the mine & see that no Ore be carried away till the Kings pleasure should be known. But the said three Commissioners at Edinburgh, having found Thomas much more skilful  in the business they were sent upon then his brother Iames, sent Thomas to London to give an Account of the Report & of the whole affair, & deteined Iames to watch the Mine. See Mr Drummonds above-mentioned Letter of Feb. 16, 1717. It was not therefore by Sir Isaacs order that Iames Hamilton staid in Scotland to watch the Mine. And there is no reason that Sir Isaac should pay the wages of a man whom he did not imploy. After Brandshagen came to London he loitered till April 29 before he gave in the Report & till May 17th before he petitioned for the money due for their services. And there is no reason that  Sir I. N. should pay 10s  per diem to Iames Hamilton during the   twelve weeks  which were spent by Brandshagens loitering Iames Hamilton demands 10s per diem for watching the Mine. 145 days. It is not certain that he watched it so long before he had notice to come away. The whole business after Feb. 19 might have been dispatched in a third part of that time. And Sir Isaac Newton was not the occasion of any delays. The Earl of Lauderdale, Mr Haldane, & Mr Drummond, who were joyned in Commission with Brandshagen & Hamilton to survey the Mine & see the Ore cut of from it & assayed, accounted their Commission by the Princes Warrant at an end when they finished their Report & sent it away to London, as appears by their Letters above mentioned to Sir Is. Newton dated Ian 8 & Ian 24, 1717. Brandshagen delivered the Report & Assays & Ores to the Commissioners for the moneys due to him & the two Hamiltons for that service representing that it ended Apr. 29. On Iune 17 the said Commissioners referred the  Petition to Sir Isaac Newton directing him to state the case of Brandshagen & the two Hamiltons, & report his opinion what was fit to be done thereupon for discharging the Princes Warrant & putting an end to all further demands of any of them on this account. On Iune 27 Sir Isaac gave in his Report of what was due to all three till Feb. 19th, the day on which their Commission ended, & left it to the Commissioners of the Treasury to allow to Iames Hamilton what they should think fit for watching the Mine after Feb. 19. And on Iuly 24 the Commissioners of the Treasury issued their Warrant to the Earl of Halifax to pay to Dr I. Fr. Fauquier, the arrieres due to  the said Brandshagen & the two Hamiltons according to the said Report, & further added a round summ of 20li for  Iames Hamilton for watching the Mine after Feb. 19. And The Dr received & paid them their arrieres. Sir I. Newton neither received nor paid any moneys for or to Iames Hamilton or on account of the Princes Warrant nor had any benefit by that business. He acted all along by order & had nothing to do in that matter after Iune 27 the day on which he gave in his final Report. The Commissioners in Scotland. Sir Is. Newton, & the Commissioners of the Treasury all agreed that the Execution of the Princes Warrant was finished Feb. 19. Brandshagen petitioned for the allowance of 20s per diem to himself & 10s per diem to the two Hamiltons till Apr. 29 the day on which he delivered the Report to the Commissioners of the Treasury but was over-ruled by the said Commissioners & submitted. For they were appointed Iudges of this matter by the Princes Warrant."

For the Coinage duty in England amounts usually to eight or ten thousand pounds per annum. But of late years no Coinage Duty (so far as I can learn) has been  transmitted  from Scotland into the Exchequer.  The Officers of his Majestys Mint in Scotland should apply to the Commissioners of the Customes in Scotland to take care that this Duty be duly collected there & sent to the Exchequer in London,  so that the whole Coinage Duty arising by this Act in both nations may be sufficient for the support of both Mints. The Coynage Duty is by the Coinage Acts & the Indentures of the Mints, imprest to both Mints upon Account. And yet no Account has been made up for the monys imprest to the Mint in Scotland during the last twelve years, although the summs imprest amount to about ten thousand pounds  And without passing Accounts there can be no coinage without leaving the Master & Worker to spend as little as he can & put the surplus in his pocket. There is no certain summ presented by any Act of Parliament to be imprested to either Mint  for bearing the charge of coinage but all the monies  are here imprest in general terms for the use & service of the Mint without distinguishing how much is for salaries & repairs of building & how much for coinage  The distinction is made only in passing the Accounts. And by the Act of Vnion both Mints ought to be upon the same foot.  The Treasury is already impowered to impress moneys for the use & service of that Mint including the charge of coinage:  But to appoint appoint a certain annual summ by Act of Parliament is to put that Mint upon a different foot from the Mint in England  contrary to the Act of Vnion & may end in bringing the Allowance to an Annuity without Account  And if this Annuity should arise out of the coinage Duty of England alone, it would be a discourragement of the  coinage in England by turning the coinage money into {Pensions} contrary to the Treaty of Vnion.  Vpon the last renuing of this Act a clause was inserted into it for impressing the coinage moneys to the General of the Mint in Scotland: which puts the two Mints upon a different foot contrary to the Act of Vnion & makes the Master of that Mint an useless Officer. For if the General pays all the  charges of coinage & accounts for the same: the  workmen imployed in the coinage become his servants & he becomes Master & Worker. tho he be not called by that name  There is no certain summ present by any Act of Parliament to be  imprest to either Mint for bearing the  charges of coinage but all the moneyes are imprest to the Mint in England in general terms for the use & service of this Mint, & should be imprest in the same general terms to the Mint of Scotland that both Mints may be upon the same foot according to the Act of Vnion.  In the Coinage Acts there is a clause that the salaries & incident charges   in the Mint in England shall not in any one yeare exceed the sum of 3500li: but this related  not to the manner of impressing the moneys but only to the passing of the accounts, vizt that in passing the Account of this Mint there shall not be allowed  above the summ of  3500li for salaries & incident charges. And in the coinage Act made 1708 there is  a clause that the  salaries & incident charges of the Mint in Scotland shall not exceed the summ of 1200 pounds: but this (in my opinion{)} related only to the passing of the Accounts.  The moneys ought to be impressed to that Mint in general terms for use & service of that Mint, & in passing the Accounts the salaries & incident ought not to exceed the summ of 1200li in any one year. Otherwise the two mints will not be upon the same foot as they 
     <217v> 
        ought to be by the Act of Vnion. And if a certain summ be annually imprest for salaries & incident charges{;} alone there is danger that it may end an Annuity without Account.

And by the Comptrollers account (to which Mr Wood agreed,) there has been coined from Lady day 1723 to March 28th 1724, in half pence fifty & five Tunns, five hundred & three quarters & twelve ounces, & in farthings three Tunns, seventeen hundred, two Quarters ten pound weight & eight ounces averdupois. And by the specimens of this coinage which have from time to time been taken from the several parcels coined &  sealed up in papers & put into the Pix, we found that sixty half pence weighed fourteen ounces Troy & eighteen penny weight, which is about a quarter of an ounce above one pound averdupois; & that thirty farthings weighed three ounces & three quarters of an ounce Troy & forty six grains which is also above the weight required by his Patent; the whole coynage amounting to 59 Tuns, 3 1 Quarter. 11lwt & 4oz. We found also that both halfpence & farthings when heated red hot spread very thin under the hammer without cracking, as your Lordships may see by the pieces now laid before you. But although the copper was very good & the money one piece with another was full weight, yet the single pieces were not so equally coined in weight as they should have been. We found also that thirty & two old half pence coined for Ireland in the reigns of king Charles the second, king Iames the second, & king William & Queen Mary, & produced by Mr Wood, weighed six ounces & eighteen penny weight Troy, that is 10312 grains a piece with another. They were much worn. And if about six or seven grains be allowed to each of them one with another for loss of their weight by wearing (the copper money coined for England in the reign of king William being already as much lightned by wearing,) they might at first weigh about half a pound Averdupois one with another: whereas thirty of those coyned by Mr Wood, are to be of that weight. They were also made of bad copper. Two of those coined in the reign of king Charles the second wasted much in the fire, & then spread thin under the hammer but not so well without cracking as those of Mr Wood. Two of those coined in the reign of king Iames the second wasted more in the fire & were not malleable when red hot. Two of those coined in the reign of king William & Queen Mary wasted still more in the fire & turned to an unmalleable substance like a cynder, as your Lordships may see by the pieces now laid before you. By the Assays we reccon the copper of Mr Woods half pence & farthings to be of about the same goodness & value with the copper of which the copper money is coyned  in the Kings mint for England, or worth in the Market about 12 or 13 pence per pound weight Averdupois; & the copper of which the half pence were coined for Ireland in the reigns of king Charles, king Iames, & king William to be much inferior in value, & almost of no value in the market, the mixture being unknow{n} & not bearing the fire for converting it to any further use untill it be refined. The half pence & farthings  in the Pix coyned by Mr Wood had on one side the head of the king with this inscription GEORGIUS DEI GRATIA REX, & on the reverse a woman sitting with a Harpe by her left side & above her the inscription HIBERNIA with the date. The half pence coined in the reigns of King Charles, King Iames & King William, had on one side the head of king Charles or king Iames or King William & Queen Mary, & on the reverse a

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of Sept. 23, 1725, that we should cause the weight & assay of five sorts of new Portugal gold coins to be taken, & report the same to your Lordships, with our opinion at what value they may reasonably go in Ireland in case his Majesty should think fit to make them current there by Proclamations. We have caused five pieces of the said gold coynes, one of each sort, new out of the Portugal Mint, to be weighed & assayed. And they proved as follows. By these assays the coyn is standard, & by the weights of the pieces the five species are in the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 in weight. The pieces of the biggest species weighing 18dwt 9gr are worth 3li. 11s. 8d each as they come fresh out of the mintsupposing a Guinea to be worth 1li. 1s.. And according to this valuation, the next in bigness are worth 1li. 15s. 10d each; the middlemost are worth 17s 11d each; the least but one are worth nine shillings each abating an halfpenny; & the least are worth 4s 6d each abating a farthing. These are their values in England  one with another when they come fresh out of the Portugal Mint: But the Merchants are apt to pick out the lightest pieces for Ireland, & send the heaviest pieces to the melting pot. And those pieces which are full weight when they come fresh out of the Mint, will soon grow lighter by wearing in Portugall before they come into Ireland. And the smallest pieces will weare fastest in proportion to their weight & value. And some abatement in the value ought to be made for this lightness. If therefore this Portugal money is to be made current in Ireland, we are humbly of opinion that the biggest pieces should not be current for more then the value of three Guineas & the third part of a Guinea in Irelandor not for above 4  pence more. The next in bigness may be current for half the value of the biggest: the middlemost for a quarter of that value: the least but one for the eighth part of that value: & the least for a sixteenth part  thereof, if these be not too little to be made current.

Whereupon I caution'd Mr. Vanderesh not to sett them out for melting, Intending to apprize You of the Affaire, 
     <108v> that the said Suspected Ingots might be further examined before their delivery to the Melter. A timely caution being necessary to make us safe, for the future. I have taken all the Care I cou'd in examining what has already been assayd, at the Cutting, hammering, sheering, appearance on the Copples, & after nealing: but because this may'nt be sufficient, I would further propose that all the suspected Ingotts be broke in {your}{their} presence, the Companys Refiner & Agent attending, & also {your}{their} Melter, when We may be better assur'd of the Nature of the Mass by a careful inspection of the breaches, than we can be, by an Assay taken off at one Corner.

And the remainder is the clear value of the Goods according which the said Duties are to be paid, that is, upon which they are to be laid & rated , that is, the clear value to be taxed. The Merchant is not to be taxed for these  three deductions because they are not his money but his debts charges & abatements  taken out of the Gross price. And the remainder is the clear value to him  for which he is to  pay the said Duty of the Queen. Quære 1. If the  Net Duties payable  In  a samll Treatise printed at Part 1689 & entituled an historical dissertation upon some coins of Charles the great Ludovicus Pius, Lotharius & their successors stamped at Rome there is a draught of a  piece of Mosaic work which Leo the III caused to be made in his Palace neare the Church of Iohn Lateran in memory of his sending the standard of the city of Rome to Charles the great, & which remained there till the publishing of the said Treatise & may still be there.  In this mosaic work there appears Peter with three keys lying in his lap &  riching the Pallium to the Pope with his right hand & the Banner of the city to  Charles the great with his left. By the Pope is this inscription  SCSSIMVS D. M.  LEO PP; by the King this D. N. CARVLO REGI: & under the feet of Peter this, BEATE PETRE dona vitam Leoni PP, ET BICTORIAM CAROLO REGI DONA. By the inscriptions it appears that this piece of Mosaic work was made before Charles was Emperor  suppose in the year 796 or 797.  The three keys in the lap of Peter signify the keys of  the three parts of his patrimony,  viz Rome with its Dutchy, Ravenna with the Exarchate & the  territory taken from the Lombards. These were the three dominions whose keys were in the lap of Peter & whose crowns are still worn by the Pope. By the statute of 2 Ann c 9, it is enacted that out of the  value by the candle of certain East India goods the duties payable  upon those goods & the allowances for prompt payments & warehouse room shall be subducted & upon the clear value which remains to the merchant  those duties shall be laid which were formerly laid upon the value of the same good stated by oath. This Act was made to remedy the undervaluing of the goods upon Oath. Now if  by the duties payable in the said statute of 2 Ann c. 9 be understood duties which are laid of Acts of Parliament & are actually to be paid,  they will amount to  33li 5s. 11d per cent which being subducted from the value by the candle leave 66. 14. 1 per cent And the allowance for prompt payment & warehouse room  amounting to 12. 10 per cent being also suducted  leave 54. 4. 1 per cent the clear value to the Merchant. The duties by the  value of these goods stated upon oath amount unto 35li 2s. 9d per cent

The sixty, 40, 20, 10 & five shillings pieces coyned since are better 
        money in every respect,  & make up the bulk of the money 
        which now comes out of Scotland into England. Those coyned in the reigns 
        of King Iames & King William are  well sized  except {th}e ten shillings piece.
         The  valuation of their  money    may be   in the nearest round numbers  by recconning their 10s piece worth  nine pence of our money & their 5s piece worth 412d & so proportionally their 20, 40 & 60 shilling-pieces worth 1s 6d, 3s. 0d, & 4s 6d.

        In recconning exactly their ten-shillings-piece is  worth 9 pence & about the seventh part of a penny of our money, yet considering that some pieces of their money are  ijdwt  iiijdwt & iiij penny weight wors then standard  & that by continuall wearing  their money grows dayly lighter  & cannot be recoyned here without loss & that no country receives the money of another country unless at an undervalue, it  may seem a reasonable enough that their 10s pieces should not pass in England for more then nine pences: For were all their money   either worse then standard by iiij penny weight or lighter then standard by a grain in every eight shillings: their ten shillings piece  would  not be worth  nine pence.  
 these An Account of the weight & fineness of the The Scots  ever since a treaty between them & the English  in order to an union in the reign of King Iames I   have coyned their silver moneys of the same standard with the English vizt 11 ounces 2 penny weight fine & eighteen penny weight allay. For which end they have indented trial pieces made here of the same plate with those made for the English Mint. The standard Troy weights by which they coyn are also made at our mint at the same time with ours by common consent of both Mints, & our Pound Troy is greater then theirs by four penny weight & nine grains. And as we divide our ounce Troy into 62 pence so they divide their ounce Troy into sixty two shillings (for their shillings answer to our pence) excepting that  in consideration of the charge of coynage & to prevent the melting down of their moneys
        they make their money lighter by four shillings in sixty (as I am informed): so that sixty shillings of their money are to their ounce Troy as 56 to 62 or 28 to 31 & by consequence ought to weigh 425gr or 17dwt 17gr of our pound Troy (as I find by experience they do) & to be worth 54 english pence & 910th parts of a penny. The experiments we have made of the weight & fineness of their money are as follows The two Mark the Mark & the half Mark pieces coyned before the year 1675 are bad work, & considerably coarser & lighter then Standard: for which 
        reason they were called in neare the end of that reign & are 
        no longer current. The  sixty, forty, twenty, ten & five shilling-pieces coyned since 
        are better money,  & make up the bulk of the money which now comes out of Scotland. Those coyned in the reigns of King Iames 
        & King William are  well sized. Most of their money here examined is standard, none too fine some too coarse so that one piece with another it may be recconed above an half penny weight wors then standard. The Scots pay their shillings for our pence in the borders of 
        England & putt off our crown pieces for 65  & sometimes 66 of their shillings in 
        Scotland (as I am told) which being an advantage of 8 or 10 per cent has  filled the borders of England with their 
        money & Scotland with ours.  And the carrying on of this trade  might  in time have prompted them to melt down 
        our money & carry it to their mint.  The passing of our crowns for 66 shillings scotch is after the rate of  11 shillings for 10d or 10s for 9111, which considering that some pieces of their money are jdwt ijdwt iijdwt & iiijdwt worse then standard  & some are light, is about the just value, as you may perceive by the foregoing Table. But because all nations to  discourage the importation of forreign money & secure themselves from loss by the receipt of  base & light money amongst it, receive it not but at an undervalue it may be more reasonable  their ten shillings pieces in England for nine pences their five shillings pieces for four pence-half pennys & their Mark & half Mark pieces (when ever they shall coyn any more of them) for shillings & sixpences. And  so proportionally of their other standard money. For these are round & ready recconings fit for use & approach the true value of their moneys,  with the abatement of only 1 per cent,  for our security,  which is a very small one, considering that their money may be more easily counterfeited then ours & grows lighter dayly by wearing. If the scotch money were all coyned of a just allay & weight  11s. 9d. of 
        such money would be worth 10d34 of ours. But being found one piece with another at least obwt  wors then standard, 11s 6d scotch is  worth only 10d12 english  But because all nations  to discourage the importation of forreign money & secure themselves from loss by the  receipt of light & base money amongst it receive it not but at an undervalue  the Scots receive our  twelve pence in Scotland only for 13 shillings of their money. And 'tis reasonable that we should undervalue their money as much  in England as they do ours in Scotland  which may be conveniently done by receiving their 10s pieces for 9 pences,  their 5s pieces for  four pence halfpennies & their Mark & half mark pieces (whenever they shall coyn any more of them) for shillings & sixpences, & so proportionally of their other pieces of money. For these are round & ready recconnings fit for use & approach the true value of their money with the abatement of only 1 or 113 per cent for our security, which is a very very small one considering that their money may be more easily counterfeited then ours."

        of the Mint shall at all times have hold & peaceably enjoy all places houses & 
        grownds as well builded as unbuilded within the said Mint which heretofore 
        have been called reputed or taken for the Mint without the medling let or 
        disturbance by the  Chief Governour Constable Lieutenant or any other 
        Officer or Minister of the Tower. This  grant is of above 160 years standing 
        as I 
        
        find by copies of old Indentures. And no mention being made therein of any Officer of the 
        Ordnance, it seems to have been made before that Office was erected. About the year 1577 a Smiths shop in the Mint was put into repairs by 
            the Office of Ordnance & has since being frequently  repaired by them. 
            
            And the same smith has usually been Smith of the Mint also & had a fourge at the end of the Mill rooms 
            for making  dyes & puncheons for the Mint. When the coinage was set on foot by the mill & press which was in the year 1665, there was an 
            order of Council for removing all strangers out of the Mint: but the Smith 
            was not removed; whether because he was Smith to both Offices or for any other 
            reason I do not know. Mr Slingsby about 
             about 80 years ago
             endeavoured to remove this Smith of the Office of Ordnance 
            out of the Mint 
            & a Committee of Council came to the  Tower to view whether another place  in the Tower might be found for the said Smith & about that time the further end of the Mint was put into the 
            hands of the  Office of Ordnance  & a new Gate built for bounding the Mint 
            at that end & there has been a tradition in the Mint that  the Office of Ordnance was on that account  to have quitted the  smiths shop  with the fourge over against it. But   the writings relating to that matter being carried away by Mr Hoars Executrix.  In the year 1699 the Surveyor of the Ordnance to rebuilt the Smiths Shop, & I opposed it & he represented that the further end of the Mint was not  sufficient for the business of their Smith. And the Board of the Ordnance  sent the letter to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury who thereupon quashed the dispute without acquainting me with that Letter, or inquiring further into it. On the 23d Febr. last I received  from the board of Ordnance a letter directed to the principal Officers of the Mint a copy of which is hereunto annexed. But we having no board to return an answer to it I   waited upon Generall Wills & told him that  no authority to treat with them about the contents thereof. 
    They have since built a new house in the Mint for their Clerks & are turning the Smiths shop into another house for Clerks, & would have me agree with them about a partition wall between that house & one of ours: but I have no authority to meddle with it. The gates at both ends of the Mint being in the custody of the Porter of the Mint, the Officers of the Ordnance can have no  right to bring in Carts with bricks & Timber for building between the gates  without leave. It is represented that the Officers of the Mint let their houses to forreigners,  
        & why may not the Clerks of the Ordnance as well as  strangers live in the Mint. But  disorders ought  to be remedied & not drawn into president & made incurable. The Mint is under the government of a board, & at present we have no board, but this disorder is not to be drawn into president."

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to us 
        by Mr Lowndes we have considered the Memorial of the Chancellour of 
        Ireland about erecting a Mint in that kingdom with the Report of the 
        late Warden & Master & the other Papers accompanying them, and by those Papers we find that the Officers of the Mint have long been cautious in this matter. For in a Report made by them about 39 years ago they use these words. ""It hath been, say they, the policy & caution of King's & Queens of England to stock their Realm of Ireland with monies (both for quantity and quality) coyned in their Mint in the Tower of London whereof one part yet retains the name of the Irish Mint; and King Iames (of happy memory) by his Indenture of the Mint caused his Moneys stampt for Ireland to be charged with an Harp crowned for distinctions sake whose Reasons and examples (as we submissively conceive) may well admit your Lordships first consideration.{""} We understand also that the late Warden & Master in their Report  were the more cautious by reason of a designe then on foot of perswading the people of Ireland that their Parliament & government ought not to be subordinate to that of England. And we do not see but that the Government of England has ever been cautious in this matter For tho a Mint in Ireland may have been upon several occasions much desired yet it has either not been granted or not suffered to continue. Among the Papers above mentioned we find a Warrant for erecting such a mint soon after the restauration of King Charles the second but the designe is not yet put in execution. Yet a Mint for coyning English money there may tend to encrease the species if care be first taken by due laws as in England to prevent the melting it down for the Indies or otherwise exporting it. For if his Majesty upon comparing the reasons on both sides (some of which are above our judgment) shall please that a Mint be erected in Ireland, we are humbly of opinion (for the reasons of  our Predecessors in the Papers communicated to us) that the monies coyned there should be of the same weight allay species & stamp or impression with the monies of England, adding only such a mark of distinction as his Majesty shall think fit & that the mint be under the same rules & laws with this in the Tower but with such retrenchments of salaries & Officers as may conveniently be made; and that the same valuation of the moneys & same proportion of gold to silver be observed in both nations. And we are ready to promote the setting up of such a Mint after the best manner and particularly 
        
         <213r> 
        
        to supply them with standard weights, Trial pieces, Dyes & Coyning Tools & to try their money & instruct their Officers at their first setting out But if a standing Mint should be desired for coyning from time to time the Bullion of Merchants & others (as the words of the Memorial may import) we believe it may put Ireland to a greater charge then to coyn such Bullion in London, by means of an Exchange at Dublin. Vpon enquiring into the state of the Coyn in Ireland we understand that the forreign coyns which make a great part of their silver moneys are generally in great pieces (as Ducatons & Pieces of eight) which are inconvenient for change & that the want of smaller silver monies has incouraged the coyning of so great quantities of copper monies for change as to be complained of: and if for remedying this inconvenience a Mint be desired to coyn those forreign monies or any part of them into small English money (shillings & sixpences) we believe it may be  cheapest & best for Ireland & safest for England to have this coynage dispatcht at once by erecting a Mint in Ireland for some short time (as eighteen months or two years) & by lowering the value of the forreign monies to bring them into that Mint. But we humbly lay before your Lordships that the late Country Mints were in disorder & left their Accompts full of difficulties & that the breaking up of such a Mint may increase the number of false coyners. And we heare that the English money is now grown much more plentifull in Ireland in proportion to the forreign then it was a few years ago so that the want of change is in good measure vanishedg & is still decreasing, the forreign monies having lately found a good market in London for the East Indies. If the Government of Ireland shall think fit to discourage the exportation of English money by setting a value something lower upon the forreign so that when Merchants or others have occasion to export gold or silver they may chuse rather to export the forreign monies then the English it will much promote the encrease of the English moneys in Ireland. A difference of one or two per cent in the value of the monies may be sufficient for this purpose, & will mend the exchange to the profit of Ireland without hindring the importation of the monies of Spain & Flanders into that Kingdome by trade. And if the exportation of the English money were prohibited by the same laws in Ireland as in England it would still conduce to the same end Also if shillings & sixpences were for a while raised a farthing in the shilling without raising the greater money it would increase those smaller species of money at a less charge then by a new Mint. Or they may be increased by returns from England of small money for great. But if a new Mint be judged the fittest expedient, we believe the directions in the Warrant of 14 Car. II amongst the Papers referred to us may be proper for such a purpose if applied & restrained to the present way of coyning by the Mill & Press without a seigniorage & without the penalty of Fine & Ransome upon two penny weight remedy in the single pieces & with the trial of their Pix by the Assaymaster & Weigher &

        of Merchants & others perpetually, we humbly beg leave to repeat a clause of a Memorial, which our Predecessors almost forty years ago, in opposing the erection of a Mint for 21 years in Ireland laid before your  Honourable Board, & a Copy of which is now communicated to us by Mr Lowndes. {""}It hath been, say they, the Policy & caution

May it please your Lordships  We have considered the annexed Petition of the Governour & Company of 
        Merchants trading to the East Indies, & find that they are empowered by Patent to erect  Mints in their Forts in the East Indies for coyning of Indian money, an extract of which Patent is hereunto annexed, & that accordingly they have erected a Mint at Fort St George. We find also that by a late Act of Parliament (An. 8 & 9 Gul III) all persons are forbidden under pain of High Treason to make or mend or knowingly to have in their custody any Press for coyning or any cutting engin or other Tool there mentioned, except persons imployed in or for any of his Majestys Mints & acting only for the use & service of the same or persons lawfully authorized by your Lordships. And that by the same Act all persons are also  forbidden under pain of High Treason willingly or knowingly to convey out of any of his Majestys Mints any coyning tool whatsoever or any useful part thereof without lawfull authority for that purpose. And that by another Act (An. 6 & 7 Gul III) there is a penalty of 500℔ on any persons not being an Officer of his Majestys Mint or Mints, who shall have in his custody a Press for coyning. All which laws seem to be here in force against the said Company by reason that no persons are authorized by the the said Patent to act in England as Officers or Ministers of their Mints. Yet we conceive it very reasonable that the said Company should be authorised to furnish their Mints with coyning Tools from  his Majestys Mint in the Tower  rather then from any other place & particularly with two Mills two Presses, two Cutting engins & the Vtensils thereunto belonging according to their Petition.

By repentance from dead works he means repentance from idolatry ambition covetousness & unchastity. For we promise in baptism to forsake the devil & all his works the pomp & covetous desires of the world & the carnal desires of the flesh.  That devil who is opposed to God   Resist the Devil & he will fly from you God hath commanded us that we should have no other Gods them himself  that is in our worship. We may give the name of Gods to other Beings as is frequently done in scripture. Aaron shall be to thee a mouth & thou shalt bee to him a God Exod IV. 16. See I have made thee a God to Pharaoh & Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet Exod. VII. I. The Lord your God is Gold of GODS Dan. XI. 36.

Thou shalt not revile the Gods nor curse the ruler of thy people Exod XXII 28 Then Manoah knew that he was an Angel of the Lord & Manoah said, We shall dye because we have seen Gold Iudg.  XIII. 22. The Angel of the Lord appeared unto Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush — & said, I am the God of thy father &c Exod III. 2, 6. There are Gods many & Lords many I Cor. VIII. 5. They heard the voyce of the Lord God walking in the Garden Gen.. III. 8.  Angels &  Princes who have power & dominion over us we may  call Gods but we are to have no other  Gods in our worship but him who in the fourth commandment is said to have made the heaven & earth; which is the character of God the father.  In this sense the Apostle tells us that an Idol is nothing in the world & that there is none other God but one. For tho, saith he, there, be that are called Gods whether in heaven or in earth (as there be Gods many & Lords many) yet to us  there is  but one God, the father of whom are all things & we in him; & one Lord Iesus Christ  by whom are all things & we by him. 1 Cor VIII. One God whom we are to worship as the father & author of all things  the God who sits upon the throne in the Temple &  whom the  people & their elders represented by the four Beasts & 24 Elders worship  by giving him glory & honour & thanks & saying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory & honour & power for thou hast created all things & for thy pleasure they are & were created. And one Lord Lord Iesus Christ  before whom the four Beasts & 24 Elders fall down & worship as the Lord the Messiah or Christ saying with a loud voyce, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power & riches &  wisdome & strength & honour & glory & blessing. They worship each with a proper incommunicable worship the father as the God who made heaven & earth & sitteth upon the throne, & the son as the Lamb who was slain  saying  Blessing & honour & glory  & power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne & unto the Lamb for ever."

                 With the consent of the General of the Mint of Scotland the Warden makes

                & if it prove without remedy the Master bears the loss. And the Warden at the same time takes out money for the Pix.
            When the Importer 
            & Master disagree about the price of Bullion the Assaymaster in 
            the presence of the Warden Master & Controller assays the 
            same & the Master then receives it & stands charged with it 
            according to the report of the Assaymaster who is a sworn officer. In cases of {moment} the truth is tried by the wardens indented trial piece.
             The Surveyor of the Meltings is in behalf of the King 
            a cheque upon the Melter to see that the gold & silver & its allay 
            & nothing else be put into the melting-pot.  Whenever the Pot is opened he watches that nothing  unfit  be put into it, & when it is laded out he sees that the Pot assay be duly taken & carried to the Assay-office. He keeps a book of 
            all the gold & silver molten & of the allay put into it. The Weigher & Teller weighs all the gold & silver brought 
            into the Office of Receipt either before or after coynage & when 
            tis requisite he tells it there. He weighs the silver moneys by journeys of 60℔
weight, & 
            the gold by journeys of 15℔ weight. The Kings Clerk registers the papers which pass between the 
            Treasury & the Mint. Also he & the Warden & Controller (by 
            their Clerks) or two of them in behalf of the King rate & 
            standard all the gold & silver brought into the Mint & examin 
            the Pots set out by the Master & enter these accounts in Day books, Leger-books & Melting books. The Clerk of the irons is at present the same person 
            with the Surveyor of the meltings. He keeps an account of 
            all the Dyes made & hardened by the Smith, & when they are 
            worn out sees them defaced in the presence of the Warden 
            Master & Controller. He now keeps an account of all 
            the Dyes that are sunck & for that end has one of the keys 
            to the great Press & to the box of Puncheons. There are also two Auditors who yearly examin & allow the 
            accounts of the Warden & Master & the Controllment Roll, 
            a Clerk of the papers who at present is also the  the Kings Clerk &  but may register Orders, Contracts, Patents, Deputtations, Controllment Rolls, Accounts audited & such other things as may be of service for the officers of the Mint to have ready recourse  unto. There is also a Porter who remove the Ingots of gold & silver from Office to Office, & an Engraver, two Engineers & a Smith who make & repair the Puncheons, Dyes, Engins & other iron work;  & are  immediately under the Masters directions.  There ought to be 3℔. 2s. of silver & 44℔ 10s of gold moneys in the pound weight Troy with an allowance over or under of 2 penny weight or 4{8}gr in silver & the 16 part of a carat or 40gr in gold which is called the masters remedy. If upon triall of the Pix the money proves worse or better in weight & fineness then it ought to be & yet within remedy, the Master accordingly becomes debtor or creditor to the King. If it be without remedy the Master is liable to fine & ransome. In single pieces the remedy is not set. It may by 5gr in a crown 212 in a 12 crown 112 in a shilling & 34 in a sixpence."

I answer that they that  culled for melting culled also for clipping the clippings being as fit for melting as the weighty money & that  they might frequently find a third part of the hammered money fit for both these purposes together & more fit then the milled money was that  being unfit for the clippers trade. But if the   men above mentioned  affirmed that  about  the year 1676 or soon after they found one third part of the hammered money weightier then the milled money was & on that account fitter to be culled for melting:  there must be some mistake in the  testimony."

For Mexico dollars are pretty equal in their weight, being one with another 17{wt} & 10 or 12gr, as they come from Mexico.  But in default of such Dollars we are not yet agreed how the payment of the surplus shall be made up in other  moneys or Bullion. If the payment may be made in the  standard weight of the silver received, then the whole weight of  the Dollars received at  Port Mahon must be taken by persons deputed on both sides,  & the weight of the Dollars paid must be deducted & the residue must be reduced to standard, recconing Mexico Dollars to be 11oz 1dwt fine: And the standard weight must be repaid in bullion at Genoa,  & this would be most for her Majestys advantage. But considering the charge of coinage to turn  bullion into current Money & considering also that  Mexico & Sevil Dollars may be worth more to the Merchant at Genoa then bullion of the same standard weight, it is doubted whether the Geouise  will take less bullion then what may be there of equal value to the Merchant   Vpon the annexed proposal  shewed me by Sir L. Blackwel, by your Lordships order for  setling the value of Mexico  Dollars to be received at Port Mahon: I humbly represent that those Dollars are 11oz 1dwt fine & weigh 1712dwt one with another when fresh out of the mint, & are then worth 4s 6d a piece & if a grain or two be abated for wearing they will be worth about 4s 5d56: a piece{.} And in this valuation Sir Lambard agrees with me: for he tells me that 1000 Dollars of this sort are found by merchants to weight 872 ounces Troy within an ounce or two over or under: & at this rate a Dollar weighs 17dwt 10gr12 at a medium.  Sevil Dollars  old Plate were formerly worth 4s 6d a piece fresh out of the Mint but are now much diminished by wearing,  &  Sevil Dollars new Plate are of a lighter species being worth but 3s 7d  or 3s 714d a piece. The Pillar pieces of 88 are finer but more worn then the Mexico,  & but few in number, the Peru pieces are coarsest & most worn & diminished. After the Mexico Dollars are told  out of the baggs they may be weighed by a thousand at a draught for ascertaining this value more exactly, & an account may be taken of them by persons deputed on both sides & weights by which they are weighed  may be compared exactly with out weights Troy by the same persons. If an eaven number of Dollars suppose eight or nine hundred thousand be borrowed: the interest at 5 per cent may be recconed also in dolla{rs} & both interest & principal paid either in Dollars or in bullion at such a rate as shall be agreed upon."

        a mill room &  Smiths Shop to be fitted up into Barracks.  The state of the matter is this. 
 In the Indenture of the Mint Her Majesty & her Predecessors have granted under the Broad seale, that the Officers of the Mint shall at all times hold have & peaceably enjoyed all places houses & grownds as well builded as unbuilded within the said Mint which heretofore have been called reputed or taken for the Mint without Medling, Let or Disturbance by the chief Governour Constable Lieutenant or any other Officers or Ministers of the Tower. Pursuant to this grant the Mint was cleared of forreigners by Order of Council about 50 years ago. A few years after, Barracks &   some houses for people not belonging to the Mint were built upon the further end of the Irish Mint at the charge of the Office of Ordnance as we have heard. In the year 1695 the Barracks were turned into Millrooms at the charge of the Mint for the recoinage of the hammered money. After the recoinage  one of the Millrooms conteining three Mills  & the Garret of the other were turned into Barracks, the other conteining two Mills was kept for the coinage of copper money,  & a  smiths shop between the mill rooms is now made use of by the Smith who  makes the Dyes & Puncheons for the Graver.  This shop & the double Mill room the Officers of the Ordnance desire to have turned into Barracks. We have as we conceive an untroubled right to the ground but do not insist upon it against her Majestys {servi}{ce}
 We have no other shop for making the Dyes & Puncheons the places where they used to be made being in the hands of the Officers of Ordnance: nor do we know where to build a new one. To build  a new  double Millroom for copper money will be chargeable & we know not where to find either money or a place to build it.  Vnder the Millroom where the Mill-horses are to go round is laid up a great quantity of her Majestys Tinn, & We shall want Warehouse room. By grants ratified from time to time  under the broad seal we have an undoubted right to the grownd  on which these buildings stand,  but submit it to her Majestys pleasure.
     Your Lordships most humble & most obedient servant but submitt it to her Majesties  pleasure. The safety of the  coinage of Gold & Silver & encouragement of Importers  for increasing the money is also to be considered, 
    & how far it is consistent with the lodging of many soldiers in the Mint. We do not think it advisable to do any thing in this  Affair without your Lord{ships} Order & therefore have stated the matter to your Lordship being ready to observe your Lordships direction therein. We are My Lord"

        raised out of the earth every yeare so there are great 
        quantityes yearly consumed & the Consumption is as greate as the 
        production, for that in some thousands of yeares there is noe 
        stock beforehand other than what is occasiond by Impediments 
        and stoppidge of Trade, by meanes off the Warre and what is in 
        her Majesties hands is wanted in Germany & Hungary for Tinning 
        of Lattin plates, which are wanted all over the world, of if they were they supplyed in the straights it would make a great hole 
        in her Majesties tinne, or were the Trades men supplyed generally 
        as they will be if Tyn be five pounds the tun dearer in the 
        warehouse than on the wharfe at Landing out of the ships for then they will have not twenty dayes Tinne among them all over this Citty or in Holland, or other places where her Majestie hath 
        any Tinne. so that there is noe more Tinne before 
        hand now than formerly only itts hinderd from goeing its 
        rounde and what ever is too much in one place is wanted in 
        another, and there is noe feare of Tinne lyeing on her 
        Majesties handes, for as the Trade hath required it & consumed 
        it for thousands of yeares, so there is noe dainger of its noncontinnuance 
        so to doe, for that there is noe more raysed than formerly. Another Consideration for advancing the price of Tinne is 
        that it must be had for all the uses by which it is consumed 
        if it were twenty pounde the hundred waight, viz. a Copper 
        Kettle of 60l: waight att 20d: the pounde come to five pounds 
        and half a pound of Tinne will Tinne it tho it shall not be 
        2 ounces the heavyer but the rest is wasted and this half 
        pounde of Tinne cost 4d: but if Tinne were Advanced to 
        20l: the hundred the half pounde would cost 21d: and 
        can it be supposed that if the Tinne did cost 21d: for tinning 
        a Kettle of five pounds price that there would be one Kettle 
        the Lesse tinned in a year. there are hundreds of tunns 
        used & Consumed by Tinning of Copper yearly. The Tin plates consume hundreds of Tunns yearly and a 
        farthing worth of Tinne will Tinne a plate & if Tinne were 
        advanced to 20l: the hundred & this plate did take 5 farthings 
        
         <585r> 
        
        Worth of Tinne, they must be had & without Tinne they 
        are of noe use. They cannot glaze Earthen ware without Tinne & if not glazed tis Nothing worth. The Masons cannot Pollish Marble without Putty & Putty 
        is Made of tinne the Iewellers Iapannners, Ioyners, Glasiers
        glasse grinders & many other Trades use putty which must 
        be had if Tinne be neaver so deare 100 sortes of smale 
        Iron are whitened will Tinne I will instance in sterrops 
        or bridle bitts which take not up half a farthing worth 
        of Tinne & can it be thought if Tinn were 5 times the price 
        that there would be a pair of sterrops the lesse made in a 
        year. In like Manner should you goe over all the 
        perticulers by which Tinne is consumed – as it is all 
        consumed except a smale Matter in Pewter which is noe Consumption 
        neither is it other than the dust in the ballance in 
        comparison of what hath been consumed. I say if I goe 
        over all and every perticuler by which tin is consumed so farr as ever I could finde, And there would be noe lesse consumed if tinne were 20l: the hundred 
        how reasonable can it then be thought to bring it to 5l: 5s:  Another consideration is, the People who pay this advance 
        and they are 4 parts in 5 foraighners by the Custome house 
        bookes it is but 3partes in 4 but Not a boy that goes in a ship to a place proper for it but will have a little piece of Tinn in his Chest & there are a greate many whole blocks runne in Cornwall that neaver are founde on this Custom house books. It may fairly be computed that 4 partes in 5 of the Advance will be so much Treasure comeing into the Nation so that  every penny we paye wee gett 4d:  and the higher tin is advanced in Reason the great is the Advantage of the Nation. & that smale parte that comes upon the Nation is not felt for the consumption doth not feell the price & as pewter is noe consumption so they that buy pewter are noe loosers for that their pewter will yield their mony again. If they loose the Makeing & that they must have downe if it had been never so cheap & they gayn more by the
        
         <586r> 
        
        rise than the Advance on the smale Matter they buy doth amount to because all the Pewter they had before is more worth & they buy pewter but on an extraordinary occasion when they have mony to Spare as a sea man when he receives his paye a farmer when his cattle comes to a good Market a trademan upon a good Bargain will geive their witnes some New fancy of Pewter and at such times they doe not feel it. Another consideration is, if wee Intende to Advance the wellfare of the Nation. there are but 2 wayes & that is by our own Comodityes or by Forraighn Commodityes & if wee cannot  enrich the nation by Foraighn Commodityes we must doe it by our own & if by our own shore it must be by Makeing the best price that they will beare, and of all the Comodityes of England I know nowe stands so faire as Tinne. Why should we be affraid of Tinne comeing From we know now where. The Dutch are not affraid to Advance their spice because spice trees may be planted in other countryes I know noe reason we have to feare daingers that were neaver seen nor heard of. 4 Cornwall I hope after 5 yeares will come in For a share For if ever wee gett up the price again I hope wee shall looke Sharpe to keep it up by another Farm, for nothing but a Farm can helpe us. Six Remakes Encouraging the Advance  1 All the Tinne in the world is in her Majesties hands or by Manadgment as safe as if it were. 2 All Tinne hath been consumed hitherto and will be Consumed if Neaver so deare the Advance doth not hinder Consumption 3 what ever Tin is in any other place is consumed & hath itts way so as if it should be brought to any Markett of ours its will be wanted where it went before. 4 Her Majestie hath Absolute Power & unquestionable Right to advance it. 5 She is Necessitated to Advance it as above. &c. 6 Itt tends to the Enriching of the Nation.

And a Livre de Gross is 6 Florens, & a skelling six styvers & a styver two Grosses, & 8 Duytes & 16 Deniers. The real gold monies of Amsterdam & Holland are Their silver monies are The half & quarter pieces are in proportion. They have other pieces of 2, 3, 4, 8, 1212 sols & divers others for payment, & Duytes or Deniers of copper of which 8 make the Sol or Stuyver. The money of the Banck (which is called Banck money & consists in bills of credit upon the Banck) is also reccomd{illeg}y Florens & deniers & is better then specie money of Bank money varies & is better then Dollars & Ducatons from 3 to 6 per cent & then other money proportionally. The buyer & seller of Bank money give 1 per mille to the Bank for entring the bargain: the buyer gives one half & the seller the other half. The Gold monies of Holland are above the specie coyns at 612 per cent, above bank money at  per cent A three Guilder piece is stampt with a Minerva leaning on an altar & holding a hat on a peer with this motto Hae nitimur hanc tuemur & on the reverse a Belgic Lyon & sometimes a Lyon & erect cross quartered. Inscription No. Na. argent G. V. &c. Mr Floyer in one paper makes the 3 Guilder piece Worse 4dt. the weight 20dt 6gr, in another paper worth 3dt weight 20dt. 8gr in another 3, 4, 5 or 6dt worse. The following 3 Guilder pieces were weighed  by me in Sept 1700 & assayed in the Tower Allowing the wast of a grain in every 6 years wearing their weight one with another when new coyned was 1oz 8gr, but they were unequally sized  erring in excess & defect of weight 2 or 3 grains or above. Comparing these observations with Mr Floyers they may be recconed 11 ounces fine, & so when new coynd are worth 5s 212d of just standard English money, or 5d. 234d of our money new out of the Mint  or in course {o}f Exchange. If a grain be added to the weight so that the weight be 1oz 9gr they will {e}qual they make the imaginary current money of which 44449 deniers de gross (or 37sch. 046 gross) equal 1℔ sterling in exchange, & 100 {de}niers de gross equal 54 pence sterling which is a Rix doller or Ecus. The Dutch therefore in {the} course of exchange overvalue their current money 3 per cent & should put 3814sch {illeg}l to 1li sterling. At 11124oz fine & 1oz 8gr weight they are worth 5s 2110d standard & 5s 3d in exchange. Three Dutch Ducatons coynd 1672, 1673, 1675 weighing 20dwt. 1634gr. 20dwt 20d34, 20{s}18d14 better 3dwt, 3dwt scant, 4dwt. The first coynd in Zeland & most worn, the 2d & 3d coynd in H{illeg} The 3d not worn above a grain or 112gr, the 2d not above 2gr. On one side a man on horsback on the other the Belgic Lyon with a sword & seven darts in a scutcheon supported by Lyons. Valued at 5s 8d a piece by the Refiners. The inscription Mo. No. Arg. pro confoe Belg. Prov. Holl. Westf. &c & on the Reverse Concordia res parvæ crescunt. If their weight be supposed 1oz. 21gr & their betterness 3dwt they will be worth 5s. 5d35 a piece of our standard money & 5s. 5d910 in course of exchange, & if a grain be added to their weight they will be worth 5s 6d a piece in course of exchange. By these assays we may reccon exactly enough that if Banck money be supposed 5 per cent better then specie money of the same denomination, & pounds schellings & deniers English, speecie money de gross of Holland & Banck money of Amsterdam of the same denomination are matically in proportion as 11. 20 & 21. That is  11 shillings sterling = 20 schellings Bank money = 21 schellings specie money; & 20 shillings sterling = 36411sch bank money = 38211 species money of the seven Provinces very nearly. Patagons, Rix dollers or Legg dollers have on them an armed man with a sword to his right hand the blade leaning on his shoulder & in his left hand a double {string} at which hands an Escutcheon with the Arms of a Dutch Province covering his left leg. His right legg stands full in view. About it this inscription Mo. No. arg. pro confoe Belg. Westf. com. Zel. &c And on the reverse the arms of the seven Provinces vizt in an Escutcheon a Lyon rampant with a sword in one foot & seven darts in the other with this inscription: Concordia res parvæ crescunt. One piece 1697 not worn, worse 1312dwt, weight 17dwt 2314gr Another 1698 not worn, worse 15dwt. weight 17dwt 2312gr Another 1695 not worn, worse 13dwt, weight 18dwt 134gr Another 1701 not worn worse 14dwt 06 weight 18dwt Several others coyned in 1701 were found by assays in the lower 12dwt worse & one of them 13{dwt} worse. They should be therefore 1012 ounces fine but often prove a penny weigh{t} sometimes two or three penny weight worse. Supposing that they weigh 18dwt & a{re} 1012 ounces fine, they will be worth 4s. 434d130. In Holland they go for 212 Florens, {illeg} is 4s. 4d12 of our money. Lyon Dollars are worth two thirds of a Ducaton or 3s 8d. Their stamp is {a} man to the thighs holding an Escutcheon before him with this inscription {Mo.} No. Ar. pro Confoe. Belg. Westf. Campen &c And on the Reverse a great Lyon ramp{ant} with this inscription Confidens Deo non movetur. One piece 1640 worse 2oz 5dwt weight 534gr Another 1687 worse 2oz 2dwt. weight 17dwt 12gr very little worn Another 1650 worse 2oz 112dwt weight 16dt. 18gr Another 1687 worse 2oz 7dwt. weight 17dwt 1314gr very little worn. Three others not assayed  dated 1641, 1645, 1648 weighed 17dwt 7gr14; 17dwt {illeg} 17dwt 6g14. They seem to be 9 ounces fine by law but often happen to be three {illeg} penny weight coarser. Reynolds puts them 8oz 11dwt fine & 17dwt 18gr weight. Their {illeg} is rather 17dwt 13 or 14gr new out of the Mint. In Brabant & Flanders & Zeeland They reccon by Florens or Guldens, sols or Patars & Deniers or Pennings (which are in {musical} proportion as 1. 20. 20×16) or else by Livres sols & Deniers de Gros which they call Pondt Schellings & Groot Vlaems (1liv = 20sch = 20 × 12d.) They have two sorts of money, One in imaginary called money de Change or Argent de permission & is the same in denomination & value with the Bank money of Amsterdam. The other is real & current, vizt Their Livres de Gross & Florens are only imaginary. One Livre is six Florens. An hundred Florens in money current of Amsterdam = 10313 Florens in money current of Antwerp, & 100 Florens in Bank money of Amsterday = 100 Florens in money of change of Antwerp = 10813 Florens in money current of Antwerp. Antwerp, Brussels, Gant, Bruges, Middleburg & all Brabant Flanders & Zeeland have the same money without any sensible difference. A Patagon of Antwerp = 96 gros de argent de change of Antwerp =  10313 (or 104) gros de argent current of Antwerp = 100 gros current of Amsterdam = Patagon of Amsterdam = 95 or 96 gros bank money of Amsterdam. Ducatons. The king of Spains head on one side with this inscription: Phil. IIII. D.G. Hisp. & Endiar. Rex. and on the reverse a mixt coat of arms supported with Lyons with this inscription. Archid. Aust. Dux Burg. Brab. &c. these Ducatons 412 better & has seldome met with any so coarse as these four. If they be better 412dwt  & 1oz 22gr weight they will be worth 5s 6d18116. Cross Dollars Patagons or Rix-dollers of Flanders have a great Cross with this inscription about it Phil III (or Carol. II &c) D. G. Hisp. & Indiar. Rex, & on the Reverse a coat of several arms with this inscription. Archid. Aust. Dux  Burg. Brab. et Co. Fl. The three first worn the 4th & 5t not above a grain or two The 4th was a half Dollar. Supposing them 1012 ounces fine & 18dwt 1gr weight: they are worth 4s. 4d12 14 18 132. In Flanders they go for 96 gros or 45 of a Ducaton. Another Cross Dollar of Cha. II coyned 1694 weighed 18dwt 414 grains not worn."

One of each metal to be delivered to the Warden of her Majestys Mint in the Tower of London to try the moneys of gold & silver from time to time coyned in the said Mint in fineness thereby, as also to try the gold & silver Bullion brought thither if any difference shall  happen to arise between the Master & Worker & the bringers in of the same. The like to the said Master & Worker to make the said moneys in fineness thereby. The like to the Wardens of the Company of Goldsmiths within the city of London in Goldsmiths Hall for Trial of their Plate & other works as well of gold as of silver in fineness thereby. The like to the General & Warden of her Majestys Mint at Edinborough to try the moneys of gold & silver  from time to time coyned in the said Mint in fineness thereby, as also to try the gold & silver bullion brought thither if any difference shall arise between the Master of the said Mint & bringers in of the same. And the like to the said General & Master of the said Mint at Edinborough to make the said moneys in fineness thereby.  The two Trial pieces for Scotland, were heretofore delivered the one to the Treasury of Scotland to try their moneys, the other to the General & Officers of that Mint to make the same. But it seems conformable to the Act of Vnion that the Moneys of both Mints be henceforward tried before the Queen & Council after one & the same manner by a Iury of Goldsmiths & by the standards of great Britain kept in the Exchequer, & that they be made & examined in both Mints alike by two Trial pieces kept, the one by the Master for making the moneys, & the other by the Warden for trying them before delivery & for deciding controversies between the Master & the Importer, as is done in the Tower And therefore it is most humbly proposed that the Trial piece formerly sent to the Treasury in Scotland be now sent to  their Mint for the use of the Warden."

The gold moneys are The silver monies are Their moneys were lately raised in the proportion of 5 to 6 so that the Moeda  now goes for 2400 Res & the Crusado for 480 Res & the other pieces in proportion & some of the old pieces  (as the Crusados) upon their raising were markt with a stamp,  those unmarkt going at the old value. But the new moneys are still coyned with the old number of Res. So the Moeda is still coyned with 2000 upon it & Crusado with 400 tho they go for 2400 & 480 Res. The Portugals reccon by 100ds 1000ds & millinos of Res putting the Mark  after thousands thus 5. 734  340 Res, that is five millions seven hundred thirty & four thousand three hundred & forty Res. Or five thousand seven hundred thirty & forty Miles & three hundred & forty Res. They exchange in Crusados or Ducats of 400 Res. They reccon a Spanish Pistols at 3000 Res & a Spanish Pistre at 750 Res. Therefore as  750 to 480 or 25 to 16 so is a Piastre (= 4s 6d) to a Crusado = 2s 101425d. And as 3000 to 2400 or 5 to 4 so is a Spanish Pistole (17s. 012) to a Moeda = 13s. 735d. Crusados & 12 Crusados of the present King have on one side a plain cross almost like pieces of 8 with this inscription In hoc signo vinces: on the other side the kings arms the date & the number of res 400 with this inscription Petrus II D. G. Rex Portug. Well coynd & curiously edged.  Ten Crusados & two half Crusados were in weight & assay as follow{s} The Crusados weighed one with another 11dwt 3310gr. And when fresh out of the Mint 11dwt 4gr or 11 412 being lightned about a grain one with another by wearing. If they be supposed 11dwt 4gr in weight new out of the mint & 1dwt worse then standard they will be worth 34910 pence sterling standard  when new out of the Mint, & in exchang they will be worth 3435 pence, or 2s 1035d. This is the value of 480 Res & therefore 400 Res are worth 2s. 456d, & 100 Res is worth 7d524 A Crusado coynd for 400 Res 1664 by Alfonsus king of Portugal being much worn weighed 11dwt 314gr. The stamp like the former but not edged. Three Portugal pieces of Iohn IIII king of Portugal stampt & edged something like the former without date or the number of Res weighing together 21dwt 2gr, that is one with another 7dwt 023gr much worn so as to be lightned by wearing between 6 & 12gr. whence they seem to be 23 of the 400 res pieces. One of them was worse 1dwt another 112dwt A Moeda de Ouro dated 1700 & beautifully coyned, weighed exactly 3dwt 10gr or 82gr. It is counted for 2400 Res but there is stampt upon it only 2000 Res. At 2{d} a grain its worth 13s 8d, but if this gold be but of 16 times more value then the same weight of  our standard silver, {illeg} worth 14s. 1d715. The Doppio Moeda or double Moeda weighs (one piece with another 6dwt 2112gr. And the half Moedas Moedas & double Moedas are one with another 14legr. better then standard. Or rather, the Doppio Moeda weighs one piece with another 6dwt 2134 grains, as I found by examining 30 parcels of  Doppio Moedas &  Moedas of a thousand  Doppio Moedas & two-Moedas in a parcel whence a Moeda is worth 13s 10d14 & a Doppio Moeda is worth 27s 812d."

        coyned by Mr Wood for Ireland has been opened & tried in the Mint by the kings Assaymaster before us. And by the Comptrollers account (to which Mr Wood agreed) there has 
            been coined from Lady day 1723 to March 28th 1724 in half pence 55 Tuns 
            5 , 3Qters, 0lwt, 12oz,
             
          And in farthings 
          3 Tunns, 17Q. 2Q.  10li. 8oz
And  by the specimens of this coinage which have from time to time had
            been taken from the several parcels coined & put into the pix we found that sixty half pence weighed 14 ounces 
            Troy & eighteen penny weight  which is about a quarter of an ounce above one pound averdupois 
            & that thirty farthings weighed three ounces & three quarters of an ounce Troy 
            & forty six grains. And that both half pence & farthings when heated red hot 
            spread very thin under the hammer without cracking, as your Lordships may 
            see by the pieces now laid before you. But tho the copper was very good & the 
             money taken one piece with another was  full weight, yet the single 
            pieces were not so equally coined in weight as they should have been. We found also that thirty & two old half pence coined for Ireland in the reigns of king Charles the 
            second king Iames the second & king William  & Queen Mary weighed 6 ounces & eighteen penny weight 
            Troy, that is, 10312 grains a piece with another. They were much worn. And if about six or seven  grains be allowed to each of them one with another for loss of their weight 
            by wearing, they might at first weigh about half a pound  averdupoise 
            one with another. But they were made of bad copper. Two of those coined in 
            the reign of king Charles the second wasted much in the fire & then spread thin under the hammer but not so 
            well without cracking as those of Mr Wood. Two of those coined in the reign of 
            king Iames the second & two of those coined  in the reign of king William & Queen Mary 
            wasted still more in the fire {&} turned in the fire to a substance like a cynder & flew in pieces under the hammer, as your Lordships may see by the pieces now laid before you. The half pence & farthings  in the Pix coined by Mr Wood had on 
    one side the head of the king with this inscription GEORGIUS DEI GRAITIA REX 
    & on the Reverse a woman sitting with a Harp by her left side & the inscription
     HIBERNIA with the date. And we did not observe that any of them were of any other form. The half pence coined in the reigns of king Charles king Iames & king William had on one side the head of king Charles or King Iames or King Wm  & queen Mary  
    & on the reverse a harp crowned.  Two of those coined in the reign of king Iames the second wasted more 
        in the fire & were not malleable when red hot: two of those coined in the 
        reign of King W. & M. wasted much more  in the fire & turned to an unmalleable substan{ce}
like a cinder, as your Lordships may see by the pieces now laid before you. We reccon the copper of Mr Woods half pence & farthings to be of about the 
        same goodnes & value with the copper of which the copper money is coyned in 
        the kings mint for England,  or worth about 12 or 13d per pound weight  Averdupois in the market: & the copper of which the half pence were coyned for Ireland in the reigns 
        of king Cha. king Iames & king William to be much inferior in value  
        & almost of no value in the Market, the mixture being uncertain & not 
        bearing the fire for converting it to any other use."

        an Account be laid before your Lordships of all the Gold & Silver Coyned in the 
        last Fifteen yeares and how much thereof hath been Coyned out of plate 
        upon publick Encouragment, & what Copper Money hath been newly 
        Coyned. it is humbly represented that since Christmas 17012 to the 19th
Instant, there hath been Coyned in Gold 7127835 pounds in tale recconing 
        4412 Guineas to a pound weight Troy & 21s. 6d to a Guinea; & in Silver 
        223380 pounds Sterling recconing 3li 2s. to a pound weight Troy. And that 
        part of this silver amounting to 143086 pounds Sterling was Coyned 
        out of English plate imported upon publick encouragment in the years 
        1709 & 1711 & another part amounting to 13342li. was Coyned out of Vigo 
        plate in the years 1703 & 1704, and another part amounting to 45732li. 
        was Coyned from Silver extracted from our own Lead Ore, & the rest 
        amounting to 21220li was coyned chiefly out of old Plate melted down 
        by Goldsmiths, and some of it out of pieces of Eight. The Graver of the Mint hath been hard at work ever since the last session 
            of Parliament in making the Embosments & Puncheons for the halfpence 
            & farthings & taking off a few dyes from them. The making of an Embosment 
            and a Puncheon for halfpence takes up the time of about six weeks, & there 
            have been two Embosments & two Puncheons made for the half pence & one for 
            the farthings. And now these are finished & some Dyes are made from the 
            Puncheons, it will take up a little time to Examine the Copper & settle 
            the best method of preparing sizing nealing & cleaning it, & making it 
            fit for the Mint: this being a Manufacture different from that of coarse Copper, 
            & more difficult, & not yet practised in England. And as soon as this 
            method is fixed we shall begin to Coyn in quantity. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships Great wisdoms Is. Newton From Sir Isaac Newton with an Amount of all the Gold and Silver Coyned for 15 Years past 23d. Novr: 1717 Read. presented by Mr Lownds

             & one of each for the Wardens & Company of Goldsmiths  to try 
            their plate & manufactures of gold & silver.

            the Treasury in Scotland by the Deputy Chamberlains of the Exchequer, if it be 
            not already done. But if both pixes be tried by the original standard weights  at Westminster, six Trial pieces will be sufficient.

        delivered  to the General of the Mint in Scotland. They may 
        be printed like the weights sent to the corporations & in the absence of the 
        General delivered to your Lordships order. For setting the coynage on foot speedily in that Mint Her Majesty may please to issue out her Warrant to the General & other Officers 
             with a copy of the  present Indenture of the 
            Mint in the Tower  annexed to it, authorizing & commanding them to coyn the moneys of gold & silver under the rules  set down in the said annexed Copy

Of the Assay  Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of Gold or Silver, & by the decrease of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to report) the gold 24 carats fine & the silver 12 ounces fine. And this is fine gold & fine silver in the sense of the law. And all gold & silver of the same fineness with the Assay piece is fine gold & fine silver in the sense of the law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces two penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being the constant practise of assaying, & the waters ought to be of the usual strength (the second water stronger then the first) & to work the usual time & in the usual heat, & the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usuall thinness that the Assays may be uniform. And the Assays of silver ought to be made with a due proportion of Lead in a due & eaven heat, & as soon as the lead is blown off & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining gold & silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold & an halfpenny weight in silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single Assays makes his report to no less then a quarter of a grain in gold & an half penny weight in silver. But if two or more assays be made of the same piece of gold or of the same piece of silver, & the assays agree without any considerable difference & a medium be taken between them, the fineness of the Gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain & the fineness of the silver to less an half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use 2. Of making the Indented Trial-pieces. The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First a Iury of workmen summoned & sworn by Order of Council procures gold & silver refined by the Refiner, & assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that is, the gold just 24 carats fine & the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt this gold & silver severally with allay in due proportion & stir them well together in fusion several times to mix them very well with the Allay, & pour them off before the Allay evaporates, & then assay them several times to see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture be uniform. It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards, one by the Assay-weights, the other by the Trial-piece Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23car 3gr 3qters fine, & by fine gold generally understand gold of this {degree} of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon
        {the Assay} {Assayers} out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it 
    {comes to pass that} Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that Gold cannot be 
        {above 24 carats fine,} not knowing that there are ways of making it finer
        {then by the assay.} Thence also it may have sometimes happened that at
        {the making of new} Trial pieces the Assayer may have reported the fine gold 
        {not so fine as} it was, & by that means the Trial piece may have been
        {made too fine. And if} the fine gold was by 23car. 3gr. 3qters fine, the Trial-piece
    
     <243v> 
    
    may have been made too  coarse. And there are other ways of erring, as by assaying with waters too strong or too weak or after any other unusuall manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or of the fine gold or suffering a sensible part of the Allay to evaporate or not mixing the gold with the allay very well, or using a faulty crucible, or roasting the fine silver or suffering it to spring in the assay And for avoyding these errors the Iury ought to consist of workmen very well skilled & exercised in assaying refining & allaying of gold & silver. 3 Of trying the Pix. The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed by a Iury of Assayers in the presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller of the Mint after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch or by weight or by all or by any of them, as is described in the Indenture  of the Mint. The Pix is opened & the Iury sworn before the Queen or such of her Council as her Majesty shall appoint. If the triall pieces be exactly made the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least liable to errors or fallacy. But a Trial piece may happen to be erroneous, & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull so also they may be usefull. For the assay by the assay weights exactly performed will discover the error of the Trial piece if there be any & how great that error is, & the assay by the Touch may be also used to see how it agrees with the other assays, tho it be less exact & not to be depended upon alone. If at any time the Trial piece doth not agree with the Assay, either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported. If it be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorized to allow for the error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the future or a new Trial piece must be made. If it must not be reported, the Mint Master must go on to coin the money by an erroneous trial piece, & the Goldsmiths will have it in their power to alter the standard without controll as often as they are to make a new Trial-piece, & to make a new standard instead of making a new  Trial piece agreable to the standard established by law. At the last trial of the Pix the gold money was standard full by the Assay, & the Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then  the money & the Iury in their Veredict represented the money a quarter of a grain worse then standard by the Trial piece. This Trial piece was made upon the Vnion A. C. 1707. It was made (I think) without an Order of Council, & by my assays very carefully made is five twelfts of a grain better then standard, that of 1688 made by order of King Iames II is a sixt part of a  grain better then standard & that of 1660 made by order of King Charles II is standard. Quære 1. If upon trying the Pix, the Trial-piece at any t{i}me doth not agree with the Assay, are not the Iury to report the error? Quære 2. If any doubt arise about the manner of the R{ep}ort or Veredict are not the Iury to make a special Report of the matter of fact & {lea}ve it to the Queen & council to make a judgment thereupon? Quære 3. If any doubt arise about the truth of the tale, w{e}ight or assay, ar{e} not the Iury especially at the motion of the Officers of the Mint to repeat the operati{on?} Of the assaying of Gold & Silver, the making indented Tryal pieces, & trying the moneys in the Pix.  1 Of the assay. 1 Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver, & by the decrease of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to report) it two carats better then standard or twenty & four carats fine if it be gold, or twelve ounces fine if it be silver. And this is fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the law. And all gold & silver in the sense of the law is fine gold & fine silver if it be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces two penny weight fine, means by the assay. 2. The assays of Gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being the constant practise of assaying, & the waters ought to be of the usual strength (the second water stronger then the first,) & to work the usual time, & in the usual heat, & the Assay-piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness that the Assays may be uniform. And the assays of silver ought to be made with a due proportion of Lead in a due & eaven heat, & as soon as the Lead is blown off & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool without roasting it, & it must cool slowly it do not spring. But in refining gold & silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed. 5 Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains & 3 quarters of a grain fine, & by fine gold generally understand gold of this degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayers out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes to pass that Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be above 24 carats fine, not knowing that there are ways of making it finer then by the assay. †
 < insertion from the top of f 245r > 
† Thence also it may have sometimes happened that at the making of new Trial pieces, the Assayer may have reported the  fine gold not so fine as it really was, & by that means the Trial piece may have been made too fine. And if the fine gold was but 23car 3gr 3qters fine, the Trial piece may have been made too coarse. And there are other ways of erring, as by assaying after any unusual manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or of the gold or suffering a sensible quantity of the allay to evaporate, or not mixing the allay with the gold very well. 3. Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an halfpenny eight in silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single assays makes his reports to no less parts then a quarter of a grain in gold & an half penny weight in silver. But if two or more assays be made of the same piece of gold or of the same piece of silver, & the assays agree without any considerable difference & a medium be taken between them: the fineness of the gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain, & the fineness of the silver to less then half an half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use 2 Of making the Trial pieces. 4. The standard Trial pieces are made by the assay. First the Iury procures gold & silver refined by the Refiner & assays then to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that is, the gold just 24 carats fine & the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt this gold & silver severally with allay in due proportion, & stir them well together in fusion several times to mix them very well, & pour them off before the allay evaporates, & then assay them several times to see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture be uniform? They must agree there <244v> fore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards, one by the Assay-weights the other by the Trial-pieces. 2 Of trying the Pix. 6. The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water, by touch or by weight or by all or by any of them, as is exprest in the Indenture of the Mint. If the Trial piece be exactly made, the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least liable to errors. But a trial piece may happen to be erroneous, & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull, so also they may be usefull. For the assay by the Assay-weights exactly made will discover the error of the Trial piece if there be any, & how great that error is; & the Assay by the touch ebing very easy may be also used to see how it agrees with the other assays, but it is less exact & not to be depended upon alone. 7. If at any time the Trial-piece doth not agree with the assay either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported. If it be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorised to allow for the error in coining the money by that Triall piece for the future, or a new Trial-piece must  be made. If it  must not be reported, the Master must go on to coin the money by an erroneous Trial piece, & the Goldsmiths must have it in their power to alter the standard without controll as often as they are to make a new Trial piece & to make a new standard instead of making a new Trial piece agreable to the standard  established by law. Quære 1. If upon trying the Pix the Trial-piece at any time doth not agree with the Assay, whether are not the Iury to report the error? Quære 2. If any other doubt arise, whether are not the Iury to make a special Report of the matter of fact, & leave it to the Queen & Council to make a judgment thereupon? When new moneys are coined two pieces are taken out of every 15 pound weight of gold moneys & two out of every 60 pound weight of silver moneys,  one for the assay before delivery of the moneys the other for the assay after delivery.  The first are assayed presently in the Mint by the  Queens Assaymaster in  in the presence of the Warden  Master & Comptroller,  the later are put into a Pix or Box to be opened upon reasonable warning before the Queen or such of her Council as her Majesty shall think fit & tried by a Iury of sworn Assayers  in the presence of the Warden Master & Controller. But trials are of the  same kind with Of the Assaying of Gold & Silver, the making of indented Triall-pieces, & trying the moneys in the Pix.  1 Of the Assay.  Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of Gold or Silver, & by the decrease of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is if the mass be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to report)  the gold 24 carats fine & the silver 12 ounces fine.  And this is fine gold & fine silver in the sense  of the law. And all gold & silver is fine gold & fine silver in the sense of the law if it be of the same  fineness with the Assay piece. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner  & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal rule of  valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces two penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being  the constant practise of assaying; & the waters ought to be of the usuall strength  (the second water stronger then the first) & to work the usual time & in the  usual heat, & the Assay-piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness  that the Assays may be uniform. And the Assays of silver ought to be made  with a due proportion of Lead in a due & eaven heat; & as soon as the Lead is  blown off & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool  without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining  gold & silver in great quantities, these niceties are not observed. Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small  & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an half penny weight in  silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single Assays makes  his report to no less then a quarter of a grain in gold & an half penny weight in silver. But if two or more Assays be made of the same piece of gold or of  the same piece of silver, & the Assays agree without any considerable difference  & a medium be taken between them, the fineness of the Gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain & the fineness of the silver to less then half an half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use 2. Of making the Indented Trial-pieces. The standard Triall-pieces are made by the Assay. First  a Iury of  workmen summoned & sworn by order of Council procures gold & silver refined  by the Refiner & Assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that  is, the gold just 24 carats fine & the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt  this gold & silver severally with allay in due proportion & stir them well together in fusion several times to mix them very well with the allay, & pour  them off before the Allay evaporates, & then assay them several times to  see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture be uniform. It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible  least there be two standards, one by the assay-weights the other by the Trial-piece. Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23car. 3gr. 3qters fine, & by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the assay, Assayers out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes to pass that Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be above 24 carats fine, not knowing that there are ways of making it finer then by the assay. Thence also it may have sometimes happened that at the making of new Trial pieces the Assayer may have reported the fine gold not so fine as it really was 
        
         <247> 
        
        and by that means the Trial piece may have been made too fine. And if the fine gold was by 23car. 3gr. 3qters fine, the Trial-piece may have been made too coarse. And there are other ways of  erring as by assaying after any unusual manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or of  the gold or suffering a sensible part of the Allay to evaporate, or not mixing the gold with the Allay very well, or using a faulty  crucible. And for avoiding these errors the Iury ought to consist of workmen very  well skilled in assaying of gold & silver. 3 Of trying the Pix. The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed by a Iury of Assayers in the presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller of the Mint after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by weight or by all or by any of them, as is expressed in the Indenture of the Mint. The Pix is opened & the Iury sworn before her Majesty or such of her Council as her Majesty shall appoint. If the Triall pieces be exactly made the triall thereby is the most expedite & the least  liable to errors or fallacy. But a Trial-piece may happen to be erroneous & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull, so also they may be usefull. For the assay by the Assay-weights exactly performed will  discover the error of the Triall piece if there be any, & how great that error  is, & the assay by the Touch may be also used to see how it agrees with the  other assays, tho it be less exact & not to be depended upon alone. If at any time the Trial-piece doth not agree with the Assay, either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported. If it  be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorized to allow  for the error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the future or  a new Trial piece must be made. If it must not be reported the Mint master must go on to coin the money by an erroneous Trial piece, & the  Goldsmiths will have it in their power to alter the standard without controll as often as they are to make a new Trial piece, & to make a  new standard instead of making a new Trial piece agreeable to the standard established by law. At the last trial of the Pix the gold money was standard full by the  Assay, & the Trial-piece a quarter of a grain better then the money, & the Iury in their Veredict represented the money a quarter of a grain  wors then standard by the Trial piece. This Trial piece was made upon  the Vnion A. C. 1707. It was made (I think) without an order of Council, & by my Assays very carefully made, is five twelfts of a grain better then standard; that of 1688 made by order of King Iames II is a  sixt part of a grain better then standard, & that of 1660 made by Order of King Charles II is standard.  Quære 1. If upon trying the Pix, the Triall-piece at any time doth not  agree with the Assay, Whether are not the Iury to report the error? Quære 2. If any doubt arise about the manner of the Report or Veredict, whether are not the Iury to make a special Report of the matter of fact & leave it to the Queen  & Council to make a judgment thereupon? Quære 3. If any doubt arise about the truth of the tale weight or assay of the moneys are not the Iury (especially at the motion of the Officers of the Mint) to repeat the  operation. For avoyding these errors the jury ought to consist of workmen very well skilled & exercised in refining assayi{ng} & allaying of gold & silver, & not to abound with shopkeepers, wiredrawers, Gilder & other persons not  well skilled in the manual arts requisite to make the Trial pieces. If any doubt arise about the goodness of the  first assay, are not the Iury  (at the motion of the Officers of the Mint) to repeat the assay.  Assaying & Refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of  any mass of gold or silver & by the decrease of weight makes his report; & if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the Assay piece, he reports it  two carats better then standard, or twenty & four carats fine, & this is fine gold in the sense of the law.  The Assay piece therefore, when the Assayer works exactly, becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner,  & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing  universal rule of valuing gold & silver in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver eleven ounces two  penny weight fine, means by the assay. The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First the Iury procures  gold &  silver refined  by the Refiner, & then assays the same to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that  is, the gold just two carats better then standard & the silver just 18 penny weight better. And when the Trial pieces are made, the Iury assays them several times to see if they be standard. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more this being  the constant practise of assaying, & the waters ought to be of the usual strength & to work the usual time & in the  usual heat, & the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness that the assays may be uniform. Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains & three quarters of a grain fine And by fine gold understand  gold of this degree of fineness And thence it comes  to pass that the Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that  gold cannot be above 24 carats fine. But if when they have watered their granulated Gold once or twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it & grind it very fine as painters do their colours & then water it once or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before, & keep it longer in the water then before, stirring it now & then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water the Gold will become finer then by the Assay, & by consequence finer then four & twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis, & by consequence then by the Assay; but the Goldsmiths know not how to refine Gold by Antimony. If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers, that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion & drive it off the Test with the same proportion of lead & hammer it to the very same thinness & water it with waters of the  same strength in the same degree of heat during the same length of time, their gold would become just 24 carats fine. But they work not  with so much curiosity & eaveness. The tryal of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by 
        
         <248v> 
        
        touch or by weight or by all or by any of them. If the Trial pieces be made exactly the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least  liable to errors. But a Trial piece may happen to be erronus,  & then other ways of Assaying may be also usefull. For the assay by the Assay weights  exactly made will discover the error of the tryal piece, if there be any & how great that error is.  At the last trial of the Pix the Iury by the Assay found the money standard & the Trial piece  a quarter of a grain better then the money  & reported  in their Veredict that the money was a quarter of a grain wors then standard by the Trial piece. The Report or Veredict  imported that 
    
     < insertion from f 248r > the Trial piece was standard &  < text from f 248v resumes >  the money  be worse then standard , tho the Iury by the Assay found the money standard full & the trial piece a quarter of a grain better then standard.   When I came first to the Mint & for some years before, the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all the remedy, & then the Gold imported made about four pounds & two pence per ounce standard. The Goldsmiths now complain that their Gold doth not make 4li per ounce. It should make only three pounds nineteen shillings & eight pence three farthings, & so much it hath made ever since the last triall of the Pix. While the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all the Remedy, there  wanted about 30 grains of fine gold in four & forty Guineas & an half, & as much or more fine silver in sixty & two shillings. There is now the just quantity of gold & silver in the moneys & there wants only about the third part of a grain of copppy in a Guinea which want is of no value or consequence being less then the thousandth part of a  penny in a Guinea & is occasioned by the  want of so much allay in the gold Trial piece: They must agree therefore with the Assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards. And therefore whenever  the assay of the money by the Assay weights differs from that by the Triall piece, the difference ought to be reported  The Assays of Silver ought to be made with a due proportion of lead in a due & eaven heat & as soon as the lead is block off the silver must begin to cool  without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring.   Then the Assay piece becomes 12 ounces fine: And if  after the  lead is blown off, fresh lead be added two or three times & the assay piece be well roasted after all the lead is blown off, the silver will become still finer but not a half penny weight 
    
         < insertion from f 248r > finer then 12 ounces < text from f 248v resumes > . In refining Gold & silver in great quantities, the niceties above described in making assays, are not observed, & therefore the Refiners fine Gold & fine silver must be assayed to know how fine they are. And if the Refiner in refining silver should in all circumstances observe the Assayers rules & proportions, his silver would become  12 ounces fine. But Refiners  work not with so much curiosity & eavenness. Their fine gold & fine silver must be assayed to know the just degree of fineness. The Trial piece is made by melting 11 ounces of fine gold with one ounce of copper allay & 11 ounces 2dwt of fine silver with 18 penny weight of copper allay & keeping the mixture in fusion 20 or 30 minutes & in the mean time stirring it severall times to mix the metalls very well & then pouring it off And assay taken from them in several places must agree with one another to see if the fine gold & fine silver be eavenly mixed with the allay. This Trial piece was made in the year 1707. The Trial piece of 1660 agrees with the Assay, that of 1688 is (by my assays) the sixth part of a grain better then standard    & that of  1707 five twelft parts of a grain better. That of 1688 is established upon the  present Indenture of the Mint; that of 1707 is not yet established  nor can I find that it was made by the Queens Order as it ought to have been. In the entry books of the Treasury I meet with  no mention of any such Order  When the next Trial pieces are made the goldsmiths ought to give a Receipt of the pieces delivered to them  for  making their plate. For tho the Gold plate be 23 carats fine & the Trial piece but 22 carats fine  yet they may  make their gold plate by the gold Trial piece by putting into the Assay scales a weight answering to the difference.  Are not the Iury to  survey the fabrication of the moneys & make a special report of the matter of fact where my judicial doubt arises & leave it to the Queen & Council to make a judgment thereupon without {presuming} to prevent them by interposing their own judgments  By my assays the Trial piece of 1660 is standard without any  error  of moment, that of 1688 is the sixt part of a grain better then standard, that of  1707 five twelft parts of a grain better then standard.  The Iury also at the last trial of the Pix finding this last Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then standard full & therefore it is not a standard Triall piece. Quære whether if a Iury find how much the error is of any Trial piece the Master of the Mint may not be an Order of Council allow for the error in coyning the money by that Trial piece. If upon any trial of the Pix the   triall  piece   prove not standard, whether are not the Iury to ascertain the error &  report it? And whether may not the Master of the Mint by an Order of Council allow for that error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the future There he melts the gold & silver with allay in a just proportion, stirs them well together in fusion several times to mix them well & pours them off before the allay evaporate. If at any time the Trial piece doth not agree with the assays either the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported. If it be reported, either  the Master of the Mint must be authorized to allow for the error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the future or a new Trial piece must be made. If it must not be reported, the Master must go on to coin the money by an erroneus Trial piece & the goldsmiths must have it in their power to alter the standard without controll  as often as they are to make a new Trial piece. When a jury is to make a new standard trial piece they are not to make a new standard but a new Triall piece agreable to the standa{rd}  established by Law.   They may err in making a new Trial piece but it is not in their power to alter the standard. And  if they err & the error amount to a quarter of a grain in gold or an half-penny weight in silver, the Trial piece is not standard & by consequence not a standard trial piece. The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay &  will always agree with the assay if they be rightly made. Assays are liable to little error, but if consistent number  of assays of the Trial piece agree with one another  without any material difference & at a medium are standard, the Trial piece is standard. And the more assays of it are made  which agree with one another without any errors of moment & at a medium are standard, the more surely th{e} trial piece is standard.  First the Iury – – – just 18 penny weight better. Then the Iury melts the fine gold or fine silver with a just proportion of allay & stirrs them well together several times to mix them very well & then  poures  them of  without keeping them longer on the fire then is necessary to mix them very well,  & assays them again several times to see if they be standard. They must agree  with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards one by the Assay, another by the Trial piece. An error of half a quarter of a grain in that gold Trial piece or of half a halfpenny weight in the silver trial piece is sensible by the assay & should not be committed. The assays of Gold &c – – uniform. Refiners find it – – If Refiners – – – made fine by the Assay. The surest way to make gold just 24  carats fine is to refine grai{n} gold once with Antimony, then mixt it with  fine silver is such a proportion as by experience shall be found to bring it to the degree of 24 carats fine. This proportion being once found is foun{d} for ever. Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small, & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an half penny weight in silver. And if two or more Assays of the same piece of gold or silver agree with one another without any considerable difference, the Report is to be made by taking a medium.  By which means the fineness of any piece of Gold may be always determined to less then half a quarter of a grain & the fineness of any piece of silver to less then half a half penny weight And that is the exactest way of valuing gold &  silv{er} in point of fineness hitherto in use. And by reason of these little errors, the Assayer  in single assay make his reports to no less parts then a quarter of a grain in gold & a halfpenny weight in silver. But if two or more Assays be made of the same piece of gold or of the same piece of silver, & the assays agree without any considerable difference & a medium be taken between them, the finess of the gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain in gold & half a halfpenny weight in silver, & even to less the{n} half that quantity  by a competent number of Assays made by a  hand skilfull Assayer. And this is the exactest way of valuing gold & silver in point of fineness hitherto in use amongst Assayers. 7. When I came first to the Mint & for many years before, Importers were allowed almost all the Remedy, & the money was coyned unequally some pieces being two or three grains too heavy & others as much too light, & the heavy Guines were called Come-again-Guineas because they were culled  out & brought back to the Mint to be recoined (as was the  common opinion) & thereby the  public Moneys called the Coynage Duty were squandred away  to the profit of the Master & Moneyers & Goldsmiths & the new moneys which remained after the heavy pieces were culled out, & was put away by the Goldsmiths among the people, was  without the Remedy. The money is now coined equally so that the culling trade is at an end. And the Importers are not allowed the advantage of the Remedy, but the money is coined to the just value. 8.  When the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all the Remedy, the Gold imported made  about four pounds & two pence per ounce. The Goldsmiths now complain that their  Gold doth not make 4li per ounce. It  should make only 3li 19s 8d34 by the Law, & so much it hath made ever since the last trial of the Pix.  9. While the Importers were allowed the advantage of the Remedy there wanted about 30 grains of fine gold in 4412 Guineas & about 34 grain{s} of fine silver  sixty two shillings.  There  is not the just quantity of gold & silver in the moneys, & there wants only about 15  grains of fine copper in 4412  Guineas,  or the third part of a grain of Copper in a Guinea which want is if no value or consequence & is occasioned by the too great fineness of the trial pieces. 10. The end of the Indenture of the Mint & of all the Rules of coynage is that the moneys for the sake of commerce have its just intrinsic value And if the Iury pleases to examin the moneys in the Pix by the weight & assay together they will find  that they are as justly coined to this value as every they were. 11 The moneys cnnot be coined by the Trial piece withut knowing the  fineness of the  By my Assays the Trial piece of 1688 is a sixt part of a carat better then standard & the Trial piece of 1707 is five 12th parts of a carat better, or thereabouts.  At the last trial of the Pix the gold moneys were found standard by the assay &  a quarter of a grain wors then standard by the trial piece {o}f 1707 & the Iury reported only the latter. If the moneys be tried again by the same trial piece I humbly pray that  both the moneys & the trial piece may be tried also by the Assay & the event reported by the Iury.  For the Indenture of hte Mint doth not restrain the trial to the trial piece alone, & a trial by an erroneous trial piece is no fair trial without allowing for the error of the  piece, nor is it for the advantage of commerce to admit of such a trial. 1 Assaying & Refining have the {illeg} same foundation. The Assayer refines a small piece of the mass, & by the decrease of weight {illeg} Reports  & if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece, he reports it 2 carats better then  standard, or 24 carats fine & is the fine Gold in the sence of the law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner, the The Assay is made the standing universal rule of  valuing Gold & silver in point of fineness, &  the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces twodwt fine,  means by the Assay. 2 The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First the Iury {procures}  fine gold & fine silver & then assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that is, the gold just two carats better then standard & the silver 1wt  18dwt better. And when the Trial piece is made the Iury assay it again several times to see if it be standard. 3 The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more this being the constant practise of assaying & the  waters ought to be of the usual strength,  & to work the usual time & in the usual heat, & the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness that the Assays may be  uniform. 6 The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after the most just manner that can be thought of to be made by fire by water by touch or by weight or by all or by any of them:  If the tryal piece be made exactly, the tryal thereby is the most expedite & least liable to errors.  But a trial piece may happen to be erroneus & then other ways of Assaying may be also   usefull  For the assay by the Assay weights will discover the error of the tryall piece if there by any & how great that error is,  & therefore whenever the Trial-piece agrees not with the Assay, the Report should not be made by the Trial piece alone. 4  Refiners find it difficult to refine Gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23 carats 3gr 34 fine.  And thence it comes  to pass that the  Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that  Gold cannot be made above 24  carats fine. But if when they   have watered their granulated gold once or twice with Aqua fortis they should dulcify it & grind it very fine as painters do their colours & then water it once or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before & keep it longer in the water then before stirring it  now & then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water: the gold will become finer then by the Assay & by consequence finer then 24 carats. Chymists also tell us that gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis & by consequence then by the Assay; but the Goldsmiths know not how to refine Gold by Antimony. 5 If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers, that is, if they should mix Gold with  silver in the same proportion & drive it off the test with the same proportion of Lead & hammer it to the very same thinness & water it with two waters of  the same strength in the same heat during the same length of times, their gold would become just 24 carats fine. But they do not use to be at all this pains & charge & scupulputy in their common practise of Refining. Money being the rule of commerse ought to be coyned of a just intrinsic value This value is known by weight & fineness together. A pound weight of  standard gold is to be cut into 4412 Guineas & Queres upon the proceedings of the Iury in trying the Pix.  1. The Iury being to try the monies in the Pix by the rules set down in the Indenture of the Mint Quære whether they should not first read so much of the Indenture as relates to the trial, so that they may have all those rules fresh in memory. 2 That Iury being to try the said moneys in the presence of the Officers of the Mint, Quere whether they are not to suffer the said Officers to see the whole triall from the beginning to the end, & for that reason whether they are to go on with more then one operation at once. 3 The Iury being to try the said moneys after the most just manner as can be thought of to be made by fire by water by touch or by weight or by all or by any of them, & to use the standards in her Majestys Exchequer: Quere whether if any doubt shall arise about the triall by the Indented Trial pieces they are not to satisfy themselves about the doubt by any other way of triall & particularly by the single Assay, that  Assay being the Rule by which the Trial piece is made & examined by the Iury who makes it. And if any difference appear between the single Assay & the Assay by the Trial piece, whether the Iury are not to report the difference. 4. Quere whether The Iury are not to make their Assays in the manner commonly in use without varying in the heat or government of the fire, or in the strength or quantity of the water or in the  number of waters, poured on the Assay-pieces or in the thinness to which the Assay pieces are hammered, or in the quantity or quality of the Lead, or in any other circumstance which may influence the Assay.  Observations upon the proceeding of the Iury in making  Tryal pieces. 1. If the Trial pieces are too fine they occasion a discouragement   to the merchant & others which import gold & silver as answers to the excess of fineness,  & therefore the triall pieces should rather err in defect of fineness then in excess, & forreign nations chuse rather to err in defect. 2.  By fine gold & fine silver is to be understood such gold as is 24 carats fine by the Assay, &  such silver as is 12 ounces fine by the Assay. And by standard gold & silver is to be understood such gold as is 22 carats fine by the Assay & such  silver as is 11oz 2dwt fine by the Assay. And in  judging of the fineness of the gold or silver there ought to be several Assays made as well successively as  at once  to see if the errors of the Assays which happen in excess be equal to the errors which happen in deffect.  For such errors will happen, & a medium between them is to be taken. 3. If the fine gold or silver be not fully fine by the assay, it may be roasted to make it finer & if the Refiner hath made it too fine, it may be allayed to   make it coarser, to the end that the standard  by the Trial pieces may be the same with the standard by the Assay. For otherwise there will be two standards, one by the Assay & another by the Trial piece. The French & Spaniards seem to take such fine gold as is commonly made by the Refiners Art without roasting it. For their moneys are a little coarser then the just standard. Its safer to err a little in coarsness then in fineness because the metal will refine a lttle in the fire in melting the gold & allay together 4. To every eleven ounces of fine gold  must be added one ounce of fine copper & to every eleven ounces two penny weight of fine silver must be added  18 penny weight of fine copper, & when the gold or silver is well melted the copper must be put into the pot & soon as that is also  melted, the metalls much be nimbly stirred together once & again to mixt them well & when they have stood in little on the fire to mix  them sufficiently they must be poured to let
    
    
    
    without letting them stay longer on the fire then is necessary to mix them well least the allay should evaporate in too great a quantity. 5 After the metal is  poured off it must be  assayed again severall times, & if the Iury think fit they may cause it to be assayed by several hands for their greater satisfaction And for greater security & satisfaction to her Majesty & people they may cause it to be assayed also by {t}  Quære whether fine gold  in the sense of the law be not such gold as is made fine by the Refiners art exercised in the same manner  & with the same skill  & diligence in refining a great quantity of  gold, as in refining a small quantity by the Assay. And by consequence whether fine gold be not such gold as is 24 carats fine by the Assay, & as is skilfully refined  without roasting the gold or using more then two waters   gold  is gold refined by the Refiners art after the very same manner  in a great quantity that it is refined by the Assayers Art in a small quantity; the gold being mixed with silver in the same proportion  in both cases & laminated to the same  {thick}nes in both cases & watered & with the same heat & length of operation in both cases, that it may become of the same degree of fineness in both cases, & by consequence 24 carats fine. If  the Refiner make the gold thinner or use stronger water or pour upon the gold oftener them the Assayer doth  he will make gold finer then the Assayer doth that is finer then  24 carats And if he refine it by ♁ it will become still finer. But if the Refiner  makes the gold not so then as the Assayer doth or pour on water but once or use weaker water or a less quantity, thereof, the gold will  not  become so fine as by the Assay that is not fully 24 carats fine.  And because the Refiner uses not to be of the paying & charges of making his gold so fine as  in great quantity as it is made by the Assayer in small quantity thence it comes to pass that gold 24 carats  fine is scarce to be met with  & that the Iury who makes the tryal piece  roasts the Refiners gold to make it 24 carats fine by the Assay.   And when the  fine gold is mixed with Allay in due proportion to make the Trial piece, the Iury assay it again several times to see if it be standard. The Assay therefore is the fundamental as well as the universal rule of valuing gold & silver in point of fineness,  And because Assayers by constant practise are better  skilled in refining gold to a certain degree by the Assay then Refiners are in refining it to a certain degree by the Art of Refining, therefore the  Refiners Art is not trusted alone in making fine gold, but the gold is examined by the Assay before it be adjudged to be  exactly 24 carats fine. Of the assaying of Gold & silver, the making of indented Triall pieces, & trying the moneys in the Pix.  1 Of the assay. Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver & by the decrease of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass  be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to  report) the gold 24 carats fine & the silver 12 ounces fine.  And this is fine  gold & fine silver in the sense of the law. And all gold & silver is fine gold & fine silver in the sense of the law if it be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a Rule then the Refiner & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of  valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces two  penny weight fine, means by the assay. The assays of Gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being  the constant practise of assaying, & the waters ought to be of the usual strength  (the second water stronger then the first) & to work the usual time & in the  usual heat, & the Assay-piece ought to be hammered to the usuall thinness that the Assays may be uniform. And the assays of silver ought to be made with a due proportion of Lead in a due & eaven heat, & as soon as the Lead is  blown off, & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining  gold & silver in great quantities these niceties are not  observed Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold or an halfpenny weight in  silver. And by reason of these little errors, the Assayer in single Assays makes  his report to no less then a quarter of a grain in gold & an half-penny weight  in silver. But if two or more assays be made of the same piece of gold or of the same piece of silver, & the assays agree without any considerable difference  & a medium be taken between them: the fineness of the gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain & the fineness of the silver to less then half an half penny weight. And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use. 2 Of making the Triall-pieces. The standard Triall-pieces are made by the Assay. First a Iury of  workmen summoned & sworn by order of Council procures gold &  silver refined  by the Refiner; & assays them to see if they be of a just degree of fineness, that  is the gold just 24 carats fine & the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt this gold & silver severally with allay in due proportion & stirr them well together in fusion severall times to mix them very well,  & pour them off before the Allay evaporates, & then assay them severall times to  see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture  be uniform{.} It must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible  least there be two standards, one by the assay-weights, the other by the Trial-piec{e.} Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They  seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains 3 quarters of a grain fine, & by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayers out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes  to pass that Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be above 24 carats fine, not knowing that there are ways of making it finer then by the assay. Thence also it may have sometimes happened that at the making of new Trial-pieces the Assayer may have reported the fine gold not so fine as it really was, & by that means the Trial piece may have been made too fine. And  if the fine gold was by 23car. 3gr. 3qters fine, the Trial piece may have been made too coarse. And there are other ways of  erring as by assaying after any unusual manner, or by scattering any part of the allay or of the  gold or suffering a sensible quantity of the allay to evaporate or not mixing  the gold with the allay very well, or using a faulty crucible. 3 Of trying the Pix. 1 The tryall of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed by a Iury of Assayers  in the 
        
         < insertion from f 289r > presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller of the Mint < text from f 288v resumes >  
        
        after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by weight or by all or by any of them, as is exprest in the Indenture  of the Mint The Pix is opened & the Iury sworn before her Majesty or such of her Council as her Lordship shall  appoint. If the Triall  pieces be exactly made the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least  liable to errors. But a Trial piece may happen to be erroneous & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull, so also they  may be usefull. For the Assay by the Assay weights exactly performed will discover the error of the Trial piece if there be any, & how great that error  is, & the Assay by the touch may be also used to see how it agrees with the  other Assays, but it is be less exact & not to be depended upon alone. 3 If at any time the Trial-piece doth not agree with the Assay, either  the error must be reported by the Iury or it must not be reported.  If it  be reported, either the Master of the Mint must be authorized to allow for the error in coining the money by that Trial piece for the future or  a new Trial piece must be made. If it  must not be reported the Master must go on to coin the money by an erroneous Trial piece, & the  Goldsmiths must have it in their power to alter the standard without controll as often as they are to make a new Trial-piece, & to make a new standard instead of making a new Trial piece agreeable to  the standard established by law. 2 At the last trial of the Pix the gold money was standard full by the  Assay, & the Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then the money, & the Iury in their Veredict represented the money a quarter of a grain  worse then standard  by the Trial piece. . This Trial piece was made  A.C. 1707 it was made (I think) without the Queens order  & by my Assays very carefully made is five twelfts of a grain  better then standard, that of 1688  made by order of King Iames II  is a  sixt part of a grain better then standard, & that of 1660 made by  order of King Charles II is standard.  Quære 1. If upon trying the Pix, the Trial-piece at any  time doth not  agree with the Assay, whether are not the Iury to  report the error?  Quære 2. If any  doubt arise about the manner of the Report  or Veredict, whether are not the Iury to make a special Report  of the matter of fact, & leave it to the Queen  & Council to make a  judgment thereupon? Of the fabrication & triall of the moneys of Gold & silver by the assay.  Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver & by the decrease of its weight makes his report. And if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass be of the same fineness with the refined Assay-piece, he reports (or ought to  report) it two carats better then standard, or twenty & four carats fine: & this is fine gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-piece therefore when the Assayer works exactly becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the Law. And all gold & silver in the sense of the law is fine gold & fine silver if it be of the same fineness with the Assay-piece. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner, & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal  Rule of  valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces  two  penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being the constant practise of assaying; & the waters ought to be of the usual strength  (the second water stronger then the first) & to work the usual time & in the  usual heat, & the assay piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness  that the Assays may be uniform. And the assays of silver ought to be made  with a due proportion of lead in a due & eaven heat, & as soon as the lead is blown off & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool  without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining  gold & silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed. Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They  seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains & 3 quarters  of a grain fine, & by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayers out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes  to pass that the Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that Gold cannot be made above 24  carats fine. But if when they have watered their granulated gold once or twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it & grind it very fine as painters do their colours, & then water it once or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before & keep it longer in the water then before stirring it now & then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water: the gold would become finer then  by the Assay, & by consequence finer then four & twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis & by consequence then by the Assay; & Gold refined by Antimony is of a better 
        
         <291v> 
        
        colour then Gold refined by Aqua fortis, & by reason of its fineness will go much further in gilding, as I have heard. But the Refiners of this city know not how to refine gold by Antimony. And so silver also by being tested with more lead & roasted becomes finer then by the common way of assaying, but not a half-penny weight finer. If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion & drive it off the test with the same proportion of lead & hammer it to the same thinness & water it with waters of the same strength in the same degree of heat during the same length of time, their gold would become just 24 carats fine. And by imitating the Assayer their silver would become twelve ounces fine. But they work not with so much curiosity & exactness. Their fine gold & fine silver must be assayed to know the just degree of fineness. Assays are liable to errors, but the errors are generally very small & seldome exceed a quarter of a grain in gold & an halfpenny weight in  silver. And by reason of these little errors the Assayer in single Assays makes  his reports to no less parts then a quarter of a grain in gold & a half penny weight  in silver. But if two or more Assays be made of the same piece of gold or of  the same piece of silver, & the assays agree without any considerable difference,  & a medium be taken between them: the fineness of the gold may be determined to less then half a quarter of a grain  & the fineness of the silver to less then an half a halfpenny weight.  And this is the exactest way of assaying hitherto in use The standard Trial pieces are made by the Assay. First the Iury procures gold & silver  refined by the Refiner, & assays them to see if they be  of a just degree of fineness, that  is, the gold just 24 carats fine & the silver just 12 ounces fine. Then they melt this gold & silver severally with allay in due proportion, & stir them well together in fusion several times to mix them very well, & pour  them off before the allay evaporates, &  assay them several times to  see if they be standard, taking assays from several places to see if the mixture  be uniform. They must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards, one by the Assay-weights the other by the Trial-piece The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by weight or by all or by any of them, as is exprest in the Indenture of the Mint. If the Trial piece be exactly made, the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least liable to errors. But a Trial piece may happen to be erroneus, & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull so they  may be also usefull. For the Assay by the Assay-weights exactly made will  discover the error of the Trial piece if there be any & how great that error is; & the Assay by the touch being very easy may be also used to see how it agrees with the  other Assays, but it is less exact & not to be depended upon alone. The present case At the last trial of the Pix the Iury by the Assay found that the money was standard full & the Triall piece a quarter of a grain better then the money, & the Iury in their Veredict that the money was {a} quarter of a grain  worse then standard by the  Trial piece. The 
        
         <292r> 
        
        Veredict imployed that the Trial-piece was standard & the money a quarter of a grain wors then standard, tho the Iury found by the Trial that the money was standard & the Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then standard. By my assays this Trial piece is five twelft parts of a grain better then standard, that of 1688 is the sixt part of a grain better, that of 1660 is standard  Quære  If upon any triall of the Pix the Trial piece prove better or worse then standard, are not the Iury to ascertain & report the error, & may not the Master of the Mint by an Order of Council allow for that error in coyning the money by that Trial piece for the future without putting the Government to the trouble & charge of making a new one? Or must a new Trial-piece be made; or the money continue to be coyned & tried by a false Trial piece without inquiring into the error; & so the Company of Goldsmiths have it in their power without controll, to alter the standard as often as they are to make a new standard Triall-piece? The present state of the Coynage in relation to the fineness of the moneys.  Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver & by the decrease of its weight makes his report, & if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass  be of the same fineness with the refined Assay piece, he reports it  two carats better than standard, or twenty & four carats fine; & this is fine gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-piece therefore when the Assayer works exactly becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner, & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of  valuing gold & silver in all nations in point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 Carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces two  penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The standard Triall pieces are made by the Assay. First the Iury procures gold &  silver refined  by the Refiner, & then assays the same several times to see if they be of a just degree of fineness; that  is, the gold just two carats better then standard & the silver just 18 penny weight better. And then the Trial-pieces are made the Iury assays them several times to see if they be standard. They must agree therefore with the Assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no more, this being the constant practise of Assaying, & the water ought to be of the usual strength, & to work the usual time, & in the usual heat, & the Assay piece ought to be  hammered to the usual thinness that the assays may be uniform. Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They seldome make it above 23 Carats three three quarters of a grain fine, & by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of fineness. And thence it comes  to pass that the goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be made above 24 carats fine. But if when they have watered their granulated gold once or twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it & grind it very fine  as painters do thir colours, & then dry it & water it once or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as  before, & keep it longer in the water then before, stirring it now & then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water, the gold will become finer then four & twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis and consequence then by the Assay. If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers, that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion, & drive it off the Test with the same proportion of lead & hammer it to the very same thinness & water it with waters of the same strength in the same degree of heat during the same length of time; their gold would become just 24 carats fine. But they work not with so much curiosity &  eavenness.  In the fineness of gold made fine by the Refiners art there is much more uncertainty then in that of gold made fine by the Asaay. The trial of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after 
        
         <295v> 
        
        the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by weight or by all or by any of them. If the Triall pieces be  made exactly, the trial thereby is the most expedite & the least liable to errors. But a Trial piece may happen to be erroneous & then other ways of assaying may be also usefull. For the Assay by the assay-weights exactly made will  discover the error of the tryall piece if there be any, & how great that error  is, & the Assay by the touch is also lawfull tho it be less exact & not to be depended upon alone. At the last trial of the Pix the Iury by the Assay found that the money was standard full & the Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then the money, & reported in their Veredict that the money was a quarter of a grain  worse then standard by the Trial piece. The Report implied that the Trial piece was standard & the money & quarter of a grain wors then standard, tho the Iury found by the triall that the money was standard & the trial piece a quarter of a grain better then standard. When I came first to the Mint & for some years before, the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all the Remedy & then the gold imported made about four pounds & two pence per ounce standard. The Goldsmiths now complain that their gold doth not make four pounds per ounce. It should make only three pounds nineteen shillings & eight pence three farthings, & so much it hath made ever since the last trial of the Pix. While the Importers were allowed the advantage of almost all the remedy, there wanted about thirty grains of fine gold in four & forty guineas & an half, & as much or more fine silver in sixty & two shillings. There is now the just quantity of gold & silver in the moneys, & there wants only about 15 grains of copper in 4412 Guineas, or the thirds part of a grain of copper in a Guinea, which want is of no value or consequence being less then the thousandth part of a penny, & is occasioned by the want of so much allay in the trial pieces. The present state of the Coynage in relation to the fineness of the moneys.  Assaying & refining are operations of the same kind. The Assayer  refines a small piece of any mass of gold or silver & by the decrease  of its weight makes his report: & if there be no decrease, that is, if the mass  be of the same fineness with the refined Assay piece, he reports it two carrats better then standard, or twenty & four carats fine: & this is fine gold in the sense of the Law. The Assay-piece therefore when the Assayer works exactly, becomes fine gold or fine silver in the sense of the Law. And all gold & silver of the same degree of fineness is fine gold & fine silver among merchants in the sense of the Law. And because the Assayer works more exactly to a rule then the Refiner, & makes better dispatch, the Assay is made the standing universal Rule of valuing gold & silver in all nations in  point of fineness, & the Law in ordeining that standard Gold shall be 22 carats fine & standard silver 11 ounces 2 penny weight fine, means by the Assay. The assays of gold ought to be made with two waters & no  more, this being  the constant practise of assaying; & the waters ought to be of the usual strength, (the second water stronger then the first,) & to work the usual time & in the  usual heat, & the Assay piece ought to be hammered to the usual thinness  that the Assays may be uniform. And the assays of silver ought to be made  with a due proportion of lead in a due & eaven heat, & as soon as the lead is blown off & the silver looks bright & glittering, the silver must begin to cool  without roasting it, & it must cool slowly that it do not spring. But in refining  gold & silver in great quantities these niceties are not observed Refiners find it difficult to refine gold to the degree of 24 carats. They  seldome make it above 23 carats 3 grains & 3 quarters of a grain fine, & by fine gold generally understand  gold of this degree of fineness. And if gold at any time prove finer upon the Assay, Assayermasters out of prejudice do not report it finer. And thence it comes  to pass that the Goldsmiths are generally of opinion that gold cannot be above 24  carats fine. But if when they have watered their granulated gold once or twice with Aqua fortis, they should dulcify it & grind it very fine as painters do their colours, & then water it once or twice more with double Aqua fortis in the same degree of heat as before & keep it longer in the water then before stirring it now & then with a wooden stick to make the gold mix with fresh water the Gold will become finer then by the Assay, & by consequence 
        
         <297v> 
        
        finer then four & twenty carats. Chymists also tell us that Gold may be made finer by Antimony then by Aqua fortis, & by consequence then by the Assay; & Gold refined by Antimony is of a better colour then Gold refined by Aqua fortis, & by reason of its fineness will god much further in gilding as I have heard. But the Refiners of this city know not how to refine gold by Antimony.   silver by more lead & being roasted, becomes finer then by the common way of assaying, but not a halfpenny weight finer. If Refiners should work perfectly in the same manner with Assayers, that is, if they should mix gold with silver in the same proportion & drive it off the Test with the same proportion of lead & hammer it to the very same  thinness & water it with waters of the same strength in the same degree of heat during the same length of time; their gold would become just 24 carats fine. And by imitating the Assayer their silver would become 12 ounces fine. But they work not with so much curiosity & eavenness. Their  fine gold & fine silver must be assayed to know the just degree of fineness. The standard Triall Pieces are made by the Assay. First the Iury procures gold & silver refined  by the Refiner, & then assays the same several times to see if they be  of a just degree of fineness, that  is the gold just two carats better then standard & the silver just 18 penny weight better. And when the trial pieces are made the Iury assays them several time to see if they be standard. They must agree therefore with the assay as exactly as is possible least there be two standards, one by the assay-weights the other by the Triall-piece. And assay taken from them in several places must agree with one another to see if the fine gold & fine silver be eavenly mixed with the allay. The triall of the moneys in the Pix is to be performed after the most just manner that can be made by fire by water by touch  or by weight or by all or by any of them If the triall piece be exactly made, the triall thereby is the most expedite & the least liable to errors. But a Triall piece may happen to be erroneus, & then the other ways of assaying, as they are lawfull, so they may be also usefull. For the assay by the assay-weights exactly made will discover the error of the Trial pieces if there be any & how great that error is; & the Assay by the touch being very easy may be also used to see how it agrees with the other assays, but is less exact & not to be depended upon alone At the last Trial of the Pix the Iury by the Assay found that the money was standard full & the Triall piece & quarter of a grain better then the money, & reported in their Veredict that the money was a quarter of a grain worse then standard by the Trial piece. The Veredict implied that the Trial piece was standard & the money a quarter of a grain wors then standard tho the Iury found by the Triall that the money was standard & the
        
         <298r> 
        
        Trial piece a quarter of a grain better then standard. By my assays this Triall piece is five twelfts of a grain  better then standard, that of 1688 is a sixt part of a grain better, that of 1660 is standard. 
    
     Quære If upon any Trial of the Pix the Trial piece prove better or worse then standard, are not the Iury to ascertain & report the error? & may not the Master of the Mint by an Order of Council allow for that error in coining the money by that Trial priece for the future, without putting the Government to the trouble & charge of making a new one? Or must a new trial piece be made or the money continue to be coyned & tryed by a fals trial piece without in {illeg}ing in the error & so the Company of Goldsmiths have it in their power without controll to  alter the standard & make a new standard as often as they are to make a new standard tryal piece?"

Which differences being  of great consequence, I have further endeavoured to find out the reason thereof that the like accidents in making new trial pieces hereafter may be  avoided. And  by the assay I am satisfied that there are various degrees of fine gold, some  being 24 carats fine by the assay, some a quarter of a grain  coarser or finer or above, & that gold may be refined so high as to be almost half a grain finer then 24 carats by the assay. And accordingly as the fine gold  of which the standard  pieces are made is finer or coarser the standard pieces will be finer or coarser in proportion.  All which &c By which means the standard of gold is rendred very uncertain notwithstanding the fidelity of  Iuries. And what I have said of gold may be applied to silver. I humbly offer therefore to your Lordships consideration whether there should not be one common standard  of gold & one of silver for the money place & merchantable Ingots  in all great Britain, setled by the asaay; & whether the standard once setled should not be preserved in the Exchequer for a rule to Iuries in making trial pieces for the future without varying."

By Sir Wm Louther Chairman of that Committe So deducting one Month the estimate of the charge of war at sea for these two last years, being 26 months by naval accompt (by deducting 129735℔ the charge of one month), amounts to 3223110℔. 00s. 00d. Observations upon the above stated accompt, 1st That the above mentioned rate of 124385℔ per month for 28410 men & for the Office of the Ordinance is stated to as great a value as if the ships had been full manned victuated rigged & Tackled set out to sea & in actual service. 2dly That the account is stated for two whole years as well winter as summer deducting only 150000℔ for wear & Tear. So the (the deducted only excepted) the charge for all the winter months (when most of the Navy (except a few ships for a winter guard) is laid up in harbour & there is no expence of shot or pouder or breaking of guns & few seamen or soldiers are kept on board, & the soldiers pay at land at 8d per day (if continued standing) but 18s & 8d per month) is made as big as it is in summer when the ships are full manned & in actual service spending shot & pouder & are estimated at 4℔ a head per mans which will fully defray both the wages & diet of all seamen & soldiers & all the charges of repairing all ships rigging & Tackle endammaged in Fighting & service. So that by this one thing the 
     
      <460v> 
         
         the charge is stated as if it amounted to above a 3d part more then the charge could possibly be, admitting the rates & number of men above propounded, which yet cannot be granted by any one that know what number of men is requisite to man that whole navy &c. 3dly It is stated as if that Fleet had been set out that 1st of Sept 1664, wheras it is notorious it was not set out till spring following, & that many of the ships were upon the stocks & repairing betwixt Christmas & spring 4thly  The above stated account includes all the charge of the Navy & consequently all money arising from the Custome house (besides all prises) were as so much ready money, being freed during that war from all that charge of the Navy which it annually discharges in time of peace 5thly No Navy was set out the next year & therefore if all this account was allowed the charge was but 3352845℔, whereas the money given for that war amounted to near about five millions & an half: so that the court had above two millions clear, besides all prizes & the customes cleared of all charges during this war. Note that in that Navy office there is a setled Rule for  manning his Majesties Royal Navy, which rule is called the establishmment, & shews that there are most men required to man a ship of war in time of war at home vizt any war at sea on this side {of} Tangier or that Canaries. Fewer men in time of war abroad viz against that Algerians &c And fewest in time of peace vizt for winter & summer guards & for Convoys And as to that 74 ships of war which were to have been part of the ninety & to have been set out against France the following numbers of men  to each ship was copied out of Mr Pepys his papers as being the numbers of men agreed by the said establishment to be the number requisite for manning those ships either in time of peace or in time of war abroad or in time of war at home.

If the late Queens contract for Tin be not renewed the  Trustees in whose hands the Queen left  5240 Tunns of Tin  to be sold for payment of the debts upon it & upon  the civil list, must sell that tin at so low a prize that it shall not be worth the while for Cornwall to dig so much Tin as well hinder the sale of a considerable quantity of her Majestys Tin annually for paying those debts. How low that price will prove is difficult to afford but considering the great stock of Tin & that Tin has been sold formerly at 40 or 50 shillings per ; it may be presumed that to sell as much of the Queens Tin as shall be dug & sold in Cornwall (suppose about 630 Tunns per annum, the whole consumption amounting only to 1260 Tuns per annum) the price will most probably come down to less then 45s per . If the Trustees could sell 650 Tunns per annum at 45s per  the sale would last eight years & produce 23000li for paying the Queens debts. And this Annuity (rebating interest at 5 per cent) would now be worth in ready money 185817li  may  therefore  be recconed the full value of all the Queens Tin. According to this recconing Cornwall would sell  only about 630 Tunns per annum at 45li per Ton or less during the next eight years: which quantity & price would occasion great complaints & discontents in that County during that  {time}. And on the other hand in the contract should be renewed for any number of years the King would receive from Cornwall & Devon together about  710 Tunns per annum more then the consumption would carry off. Which  yearly addition to the dead stock would continually encrease the dammage of the crown by these contracts & the difficulty  of putting an end to them.  If the people of Cornwall should only dig 400 Tuns per annum & the King should contract with them for it at the rate of 3li 9s 4d per , it would be more advantageous to them then to have no contract at all. And therefore if the King should contract with them for six or eight hundred  or a thousand Tunns per annum at the same price they would have great reason to rejoyce at it as a very great favour. And if his Majesty should contract with them for 11 or 12 hundred Tunns per annum besides 40 Tunns from Devon, it would be as much as the consumption would carry off.  If his Majesty contracts with Cornwall, it will be requite that he contract also with the Trustees for the Queens Tin. And if he pays for it about 28 or 30 thousand pounds per annum for eight years togeter, or  an equivalent price in any other manner. They will in my humble opinion have no reason to complain of the bargain."

May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference  of 15 Apr. 1719 upon the 
        Memorial of Mr Appleby & Mr Hines, I have considered the same & 
        humbly represent that fine copper will not run close into Barrs like 
        gold silver & coarse copper, but requires to be either battered or rolled 
        thin by a Mill; & the cheapest way is to roll it. But a horse-mill 
        being too weak & too chargeable for this purpose, I advised the said 
        Mr Appleby & Mr Hines to procure a water mill. And to encourage 
        them to do it, I  promised  to give them no disturbance my 
        self so long as they kept to their covenants in the copper which they 
        brought to me. But at the same time I told them that I could engage 
        nothing for my superiors. Hereupon they took a water Mill neare Maidenhead bridge three or four miles above Windsor at the rent of 52li per annum for 
        two years & an half (of which one years certain) from midsummer last, besides a fine of 20 Guineas & 65li
paid for tools left there by Mr Eyres as I understand by the writings. They took also another little place 
        neare it for a warehouse & lodging room & for building a refining furnace 
        at 12li per annum: & the furnace cost them almost 40li as they inform me, 
        besides the charge of beds & furniture for servants & of new Rolls & 
        iron moulds & boxes for the copper & other utensils amounting to above 
        70li & besides  an hundred load of wood & four load of charcoal bought for this service. And during the intermission of the coinage they pay 39s per 
        week retaining wages to a Clerk & Refiner & two other servants. When a stop was put to the coinage I informed your Lordships that 
            25li Tons of copper money were then coined & delivered, besides what 
            was  ready to be delivered of which I did not then know the quantity: 
            but it was just delivered & amounted unto 26  weight. And as much copper was brought 
            into the Mint that day as made 26  more: so that there 
            hath been coined 27 Tunns & 12  weight. There was also at that 
            time 25  more brought down the River ready to be delivered, & 45 
more was at the Mill in pickle, & 35  rolled but not cleaned, & 4334 
more rolled hot but not cold. And in Scissel Brocage & Cakes 128 , 2Q. 
            Besides 30 Tons contracted for under hand & seale. By the Bills of parcels several of which I have seen &c The Rolls at first were  rought & made the copper rough, which occasioned grerat complaints in the Mint till within a fortnight before the coinage was stopt, but the Rolls are now smooth:  & the last parcel of copper imported was well cleaned. By the Bills of parcells &c Vpon the whole,  considering the charges that 
        the Importers have been at, & the quantity of copper upon their hands some of which is 
        prepared, & the demand of copper money by the people: it seems to 
        me that the coinage be no longer discontinued; & that the 25  of copper 
        Bars  brought down the river to be imported when 
        the coinage was stopt & the 45  then in pickle & now pickled be 
        forthwith imported, provided the copper beare the assays prescribed; & 
        that the 35  rolled but not yet cleaned be rolled once more with smooth rollers & then cleaned &  imported.
        And  then if any other Proposall shall be deliverd in to your
        Lordships  for ocinign copper money by such an assay as the Proposers will abide by   the Proposals may be compared  with what Mr Appleby & Mr Hines will undertake for the future. In obedience to your Lordships order of Reference upon the Memorial of Mr Appleby & Mr Hines I have considered the same & humbly represent that Fine Copper will not run close into Barrs but requires  to be either battered or rolled thin by a Mill, & the cheapest way is to roll it. But a horse mill being too weak & too chargeable for this purpose I advised Mr Applebly & Mr Hines to procure a water Mill, & to encourage them to do it I promised them to give them no disturbance my self so long as they kept to their covenants in the copper which they brought to me. But  at the same time I told them that I could engage nothing for my superiors. Hereupon they took a water mill neare Maiden head 3 or 4 miles above 
        Windsor at the rent of 50li per annum for three years from midsummer last, besides a fine of 
        20 Guineas & 75li paid for Tools prepared  there by Mr Ayres. They took also another little place neare it for a warehouse

        other tools which cost them above 200li as they represent. And when a stop 
        was put to the coinage I informed your Lordships that 25 Tons of money was
        coined & delivered besides what was ready to be delivered, of which I did not 
        then know the just quantity: But it amounted unto 26 hundred weight. And as much 
        copper in plates was brought into the mint  that day 
        as made 26 hundred weight more: so that there hath been coined 27 Tu{ns}

Besides 20 Tunns which they tell me they have contracted for under hand & seale.† The Rolls hitherto used  were rough,  & by their roughness occasioned much complaint of them, but the assure me that they  have now procured smooth rolls.   ☉ besides the charge of Beds &  furniture for servants &  of 
        new Rolls &  molds  boxes for the copper  & other utensills amounting to above 80li. And during the cessation of the coinage they pay 39s per week  retaining wages to a Clerk & Refiner & two other servants. When a stop was put to this coinage – – smooth rolls. Vpon the whole it seems to me that considering② the demand of copper money by the people
        & ① the charge that the importers of copper have been at, & the coinage be no longer  discontinued; that the 25  of copper Barrs brought down the river to be imported when the coinage was stopt & 45 & then in pickle & now pickle{d} be forthwith imported, provided the copper beare the assays prescribed, & that the 35 
rolled but not cleaned be cleaned & also imported. And that  in the mean time Mr Briggs & Mr Richardson deliver in their proposals to your Lordships foor coining the money of finer copper & the Assay by which their copper shall appear  to be finer. And  then their Proposals may be  compared with what the present Importers will undertake for the future."

        mass  at the just value by weight & assay  
        to be coined He may also buy bullion of an uncertain value but not knowingly to loss, & must 
        account for the profit & loss if there be any.  But this way of 
        buying of Bullion is not in use. When  Plate or old  moneys are imported in specie to be coined the 
        Importer either causes the same to be  melted into Ingots at his own charge 
        before delivery or delivers them to a General Importer who causes them to be melted 
        into Ingots, & then the Ingots are delivered  to the Master of the Mint 
        by weight & assay to be coined. Or if Plate or old moneys be delivered to the Master 
        by weught alone, it must be by a proper Warrant for this purpose & then he either melts 
        the same into Ingots in the presence of one or more persons appointed in behalf of her Majesty 
        & the Importers to survey & controll the meltings, & keeps an account thereof, or else when they are to be melted the Master delivers them by weight  to one or more persons entrusted to see them melted, & receives  back  the produced Ingots by weight & assay. For the Master alone is not to be trusted with the melting of Plate or Money into Ingots. When the House of Commons voted an Address to her Majesty  to give
        directions to the Officers of the Mint to receive Plate & give receipts for the same  the Master of the Mint was perplexed thereat 
        having for great reasons in the case of  the Vigo plate {represents} it opposed the giving of receipts by his fellow Officers
        nothing more was to be understood by that Address then that her Majesty should give directions to the 
        proper Officer or Officers & accordingly prepared a Warrant for  
        himself alone with blanks for the names of his fellow Officers to be inserted by 
        the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury if they thought fit. But the Warden 
        of the Mint  fell into a passion 
        at the blanks, & said he would not go into the Lords unless the blanks 
        were first filled up, & desired to have them filled up &  took the Warrant from the Master. When the two million Act was published & the Master alone (after
        a stay of some days for the concurrence of his fellow Officers) acquainted his 
        Lordship with the defect of that Act & in a second memorial laid the state of 
        the Plate before his Lordship, &  in order to a third memorial was informing himself whether 5s per ounce would content the Importers till 
        the Parliament  should meet & told the Warden that he found that it would:  the Warden   declared  against it unless the 
        Importers would deliver up their Receipts upon payment of what the plate produced & take certificates for the remainder.  Which the Importers being averse from, the Master desisted   till the Warden told him that the Officers of the Mint would be summond to attend the Treasury about this matter,  & then the Master stated the case to the Attorney General & brought the Attorneys opinion thereupon to his Lordship with the form of a warrant for paying 5s per ounce. When the Master & Worker was first spoken to about receiving the plate, he represented that he  was  ready to receive it  & give receipts 
        for  it by weight  & that some person or persons {should}  be 
            appointed to carry it from him by weight to the melting pot  when it was to be melted, & to see 
            it melted & assayed & to return back
             to him by weight & assay the Ingots produced & keep an account of the meltings. 
        This was the method of coining the Vigo plate. He spake also of other methods & suspects that he was not well understood. 
 By the coinage Act & the Indenture & usage of the Mint 
        the Master & Worker received Gold & Silver only in the mass at 
        the just value by weight & assay to be coined. He may  buy 
        Bullion of  uncertain value, but not knowingly to loss, & must 
        account for the profit: but this way of buying of bullion is not 
        in use. When Plate or old moneys are  to be coined the 
            Importer either causes the same to be melted into Ingots at his own 
            charge before delivery, or delivers it to a general Importer 
            who causes it to be melted into Ingots,  and the Master of the Mint receives the ingots by weight & assay to 
            be coined. Or if Plate or old money be delivered in specie to the 
            Master,  he either melts the same into Ingots in the presence of 
            persons appointed to see it done, or delivers the same by weight 
            to  persons appoitned to   carry it to the melting pot 
              & melted &  deliver it back to him in Ingots by weight & assay to the coined. For 
            the Master is not to be trusted with silver of uncertain value without due checks 
            upon him. When the present Master & Worker was first spoken to about 
            receiving the plate, he represented that he was ready to receive it & 
            give receipts for it by weight, & that some person or persons should 
            be appointed to carry it from him by weight to the melting pot,  & to deliver back to him by weight & assay the Ingots produced, & keep an account of the meltings. This was the method  in coining the Vigo plate.  Some days after when the House of Commons voted an Address 
            to her Majesty to give directions to the Officers of the Mint to receive 
            Plate the Master of the Mint was perplexed thereat & told his fellow 
            Officers that nothing more was to be understood by that Address then that 
            her Majesty should give directions to the proper Officer or Officers, & 
            accordingly prepared a Warrant for himself alone with blancks for 
            the names of his fellow Officers  to be inserted by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury  if they thought fit. But the 
            Warden of the Mint fell into a passion at the blancks & said that 
            he would not go in to the Lords unless the blanks were first filled 
            up & at his desire they were filled up. Then  the Master 
            prepared a distinct Warrant for himself as Master to coin the plate, but 
            the Warden rejected it. When the two Million Act  was published & the Master 
            alone (after a stay of some  days for the concurrence of his fellow 
            Officers) acquainted the Lord High Treasurer with the defect of the Act & in a second 
            memorial laid the state of the plate before  his 
            Lordship & in order to a third memorial was informing himself whether 
            5s per ounce would content the Importers till the Parliament met, & told 
            the Warden that he found that it would: the Warden declared against 
            it unless the Importers would deliver up their receipts upon payment 
            of what the plate produced & take certificates for the remainder. Which 
            the Importers being averse from, the Master desisted till he heard that
            
             <532v> 
            
              the Officers of the Mint would be summoned to attend 
            his Lordship, & then  stated the case to the Attorney General 
            & brought the Attorneys opinion thereupon to his Lordship with the form 
            of a Warrant for paying 5s per ounce to the Importers, being fully satisfied that it would have quieted them till the meeting of the Parliament 
            if the Warden of the Mint would but have been content with an 
            endorsement of the payments without taking back the Receipts given out 
            for plate."

By the Indenture of her Majesties Mint  the allowance for coinage of silver money in the Tower is after the rate of 1612d per pound weight Troy. By an Act of Parliament made in Scotland A. C. 1686 The  the allowance for coinage of silver moneys in her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh is after the rate of 20 pounds scottish per stone weight scottish that is after the rate of about  1712d English per pound weight Troy  recconing 3 pounds scottish to be worth 4s 6d12 English, as it is according to the intrinsic value of the moneys of both nations. But by an order of Council of Scotland made upon the Vnion 3 pounds Scottish was put equivalent to 5s English, &  this bring the allowance for coinage to 19111d per pound weight Troy Quære whether the late coinage of silver moneys shall be paid for according to the rate set down in the Indenture of the Mint or according to the  rate set down in the said Act of Parliament or according to the order of Council & the said Act together. In the first case the allowance comes to about 1712  in the second to something more then 1712d in the third to about 19111d per pound weight Troy. Whether the
        Mint in Scotland was allowed 20 pounds Scots upon the stone weight of silver moneys for the coynage thereof. And 3 pounds Scots is worth 5412s at the just value but the Scots valued 13  shillings Scots at 12d English before the union & at 13d English  in distributing the Equivalent. Quære By the indenture of the Mint the Master & Worker is allowed sixteen pence half penny  per pound weight Troy for the coynage of silver moneys. The words of the Indenture are hereunto annexed.  The question is what shall be allowed in the accounts of the late Master & Worker  upon the pound weight Troy for the late coynage of silver moneys. By her Majesties warrant of Iune 20, 1707 the Officers of her Majesties Mint at Edinburgh for putting the Act of Vnion in execution were directed to observe  the rules of coynage set down in the said indenture with respect to their several Offices. The words of the Warrant are hereunto annexed. By  an Act of Parliament made in Scotland A. C. 1690 the Master of the
         A scots stone weight is in English Troy weight 20℔. 2oz. 7dwt. 14gr & 20 pounds were worth 30s.  412d English at an equal value before the union but upon the union were by the Privy Council of Scotland valued at 34s. 4d english in disposing of the Equivalent, & according to this value the coinage amounts to about 19111 pence english per pound weight Troy. 2 The  abovementioned Acts of Parliament are ceased & whether there by any other grant of 20 pounds scots per  stone weight scots still in force I do not know. 3. If these be no other grant  the question is how far  the judgment of the said Parliament of 1690, & custome grounded upon their Act,  together with the said order of Council  may obtein  for this allowance, or the Act of Vnion with the Indenture of the mint  prevail for a less allowance, or how the allowance shall be regulated by reason & justice according to your Lordships great wisdome.  1. The Master could have coined the  money cheaper  by  his old method of coining then by the new,  but the coinage would not have been performed so well.  Mr Foord"

The Mark of standard gold  cut into 3614 Lewidors old species & is cut into 30 Lewidors new species.  The mark of Standard silver was cut into 81112 silver Lewises or Crowns & is not cut into eight. Thirty French  Crowns new sepcies  fresh out of the Mint weigh 14120 grains Troy which is 47023 grains to a piece, which if standard is worth 5s 0d34. Deduct the trebuchant amounting to about 5gr in the piece & there remains the French ounce 466gr. Four new Lewidors new species fresh out of the Mint weigh 50212 grains, & therefore a new Lewidor new species weighs 12558gr. Anonother double Lewidor weighed  252gr but was too heavy others  single Lewidors weighed about 125gr. At a medium they weigh 12558. For as  30 to 3614 so its the old Lewid'or 4dwt 8gr to 12523 grains. Thirty of these pieces amount to 3770. Deduct the trebuchant 42gr & the eighth part of the remainder 466gr is the French ounce. By a French Mark weight an Ounce should weigh 472 grains In the fabrique of the new species fine gold is to fine silver & standard gold to standard silver of equal weight as 15 to  1. For 8 crown piece is 40 livres & in weight make a Mark &m 30 Lewis d'ors is 600 livres & in weight make a Mark.  A Mark is 3728gr besides the trebuchant. The Mark of gold is divided into 24 karats the Carat into 8 deniers the deniers into 24 grains. The Mark of Silver is divided into 12 deniers the denier into 24 grains the grain into 24 primes. These two sorts of weights serve  only to determin the fineness or quality of the gold or silver. The Mark in respect to its real weight is divided into eight  Ounces, the ounce into eight gross, the gross into three deniers the denier into 24 grains the grain into 24 primes. So the Mark is equal to 8 ounces = 64 gross = 4608 grains = 110592 primes. La Loy, ou la title de bonte is the fineness of the gold or silver Les deniers de taille is the number of pieces they coin in a Marck. La Misse is the current price or extrinsic value from which the King has the greatest profit. Le  droit de seigniorage is the kings duty for coinage. Le droit de Brassage is an allowance given by the king to the Masters of the Mints Le remede de Loy is the Masters Remedy in fineness Le remede de Poids is the Masters Remedy in Weight. Le Tebutian is the over-weight allowed by the king to make the pieces continue of full weight after some wearing £100 gross Argent de Change one Antwerp can be negotiated so as to produce at Antwerp £1010 Livers of French current money to £1020 And the Bills have produced 10 or 20 Livres more in one hundred pound gross then the specie would have done had it been of any kind but old Lewis D'ors which are not to be got in such quantities The remedy in weight of the new species of Gold is 12 grains per Mark & in fineness  1032 of a  carat instead of 14 of a Karat. And the remedy of the new species of silver

     <441v> 
        
        more easily removed by people under my direction then by such as do  not regain me. To be concerned in this sort of coinage I never desired but it falls to my lot. And things are upon such a foot that I can get nothing but discredit by coyning the money ill.
        
        
        
        I am now trying  if instead of nealing  & cleaning the Copper in the barrs the moneyers can  learn to neale & clean it  sufficiently in the blanks. And if your Lordships please to suffer me to go on with Mr  Appleby & Mr Hines untill  this difficulty is over, 
        
         & they have also coyned the copper which they have already manufactured  & And if any faulty pieces escape them we rece In the last coinage of copper moneys the copper was worth about 8d per pound weight
        
        
        
         & a pound weight was cut into
2112d  The copper is now worth  between 1312 & 14d & the coinage is b{illeg} & yet a pound weight is cut only into 23d  whereof a     three half pence is reserved to the government. These  They complain of me  & now complain of me for not acting without warrants. For putting an end to  this matter I humbly pray that your Lordships will be pleased still to allow me to try    any man's copper & to  receive or reject it accordingly as I shall find it finer or coarser & better or worse prepared & to go on with Appleby & Hines  till  I can meet with better workmen willing to serve me, & to referr to such a trial those people   who now complain
        
        
        
        & whose copper I intend to coin in due time if I find it for  for the Mint.    ① In the last coinage of copper was worth about 7d12 or 8d per pound weight & a pound weight was cut into 2112d. The copper is now worth between 1312 & 14d per pound weight & the coinage is difficulter & more chargeable & better performed & yet the allowance for copper & coinage is the same as before a pound weight is cuts only into 23d whereof  three half pence are reserved to the government.  All  deficiency in the goodness of the copper hitherto complained of doth not amount to the 40th part of the whole value of the copper, which is no more then the Remedy allowed in weight, & therefore would be within the Remedy  in fineness if the Assays were exact enough for setling such a remedy.
        
          And as for the form of the moneys it is before every bodies eyes & ought not to be judged of by the 
        
        
        
        faulty pieces.  The nature of coinage is such that amongst the  moneys newly coined there will be some pieces faulty in form. It always was & always will be so in the coinage of gold & silver, & the coinage of fine copper is more difficult. But it is the duty of the moneyers to pick out those faulty pieces  & I have caused half a Tunn of such {illeg} {coyned} moneys to be melted down again. And this has been the standing practise of the Mint {time} out of mind without any disparagement to the coynage of gold & silver. Because I am accountable for the  gold & silver moneys in weight & fineness, that coinage is performed by people under my direction. And his Majestys Warrant has made me accountable also for the avlue of the copper moneys according to the rules prescribed therein. To coin moneys of fine copper is a manufacture never before set up in England, & I have met with great difficulties in setting it up for want of time to try Experiments  before I began. For removing the main difficulties I perswaded Mr Appleby & Mr Hines to rent a water mill, a horse mill being too weak, & the difficulties are in a great measure removed. And those that remain will be more easily removed by people under my direction then by such as do not regard me. I cannot undertake absolutely that  in the copper imported there shall be no faulty barrs which may escape the assays, but I am safest in people that are afraid of me. To be concerned in this sort of coiange I never desired: but it falls to my lot, And things are upon such a foot that I can get nothing but discredit by coyning the money ill. And if those that have served me hitherto be used too hardly, no body else will serve me. I am very willing to lend the Copper rooms in the Mint to any body whomay be authorized to take care of this coinage & content my self with the coiange of the gold & silver; but if it be your Lordships pleasure that I go on with it, I will take the best care I can to have it well performed.   And that  the Memorialists may not lose their charges I will coine the copper they have prepared if I find it fit  to be coined. But I have notice that theyuse  Barbary copper  refined in London & after such notice it will be requisite that they satisfy me in that matter  least I should {be} accused of conniving at forreign copper after notice that it is forreign.  I humbly pray your Lordships therefore that I may go on in the method  which is suitable to this Warrant & in which I have hitherto acted, which is by allowing me to try any mans copper & to receive or reject it accordingly as I find it finer or coarser, & the manufacture better or worse: & to  imploy those who serve me best To coin money of fine copper is a manufacture never before set up in England {Six  pondys corporis, si uniforms sit, & tempus in æquales nartes dividator singulis temporis particulis æqualiter agendo in corpus,  æqualiter matum egus mutabit.} {Vt si corporis cadentis, gravitas equs sit uniformes, {hæco} singulis Kenpons particulis æqualibus æqualiter agenda imprimet caries æquales in {illeg}coppus allud &  generabit velocitates æquales  et propteret vis tota in coprus eudens impressa & velocitas tota genita simper erif ut tempur totum sedendi

May it please your Lordships  In answer to the Memorial of Mr Nicholson & Mr Briggs I humbly represent that as often as they have applied themselves to me I have told them that without a Warrant from the King I could not receive copper in blanks nor coin money with round edges for the people, & that without a Warrant from your Lordships I could not deliver  Cutters to them. I have told them also that Mr Appleby & Mr Hines having all things ready for a triall were to coin their five Tonns first, & that when I was ready for the Memorialists I would give them notice, but it would take up some time first to prepare the Mint for a tryall. There is no difficulty in rounding the edges of the blanks; & I have not delivered a new Cutter to Mr Appleby & Mr Hines since the 3d of Iune last as is pretended, tho I may do it by that Warrant which I have; nor are they Contractors but at discretion; nor have there been any delays but for want of Warrants which the Memorialists should have procured. But if the Memorialists instead of applying for Warrants, have given themselves a great deale of trouble in solliciting me to act without any, & if in opposition to the notice which I gave them that Appleby & Hines being ready should have the first triall, they have built furnaces & prepared a sufficient quantity of copper ready for the Cutters & been at sufficient charges in preparing the  same: they have  done this contrary to my advice, & without staying for sufficient authority, & can blame no body but themselves if they should lose their charges for acting in this manner. These things are plain facts & may suffice to shew the unreasonableness of the  Complaints in the Memorial."

May it please your Lordships  For diminishing the expences occasioned by Sir Ereskines 
        Mine & making the greater dispatch  in that busines, I most humbly offer to your Lordships consideration whether it may not be advisable that Dr Iustus 
        Brandshagen & the two Hamiltons who are sent down to Scotland,  be ordered to smelt the Ore which lyes buried 
        in Casks by Sir Iohn Ereskins house, so soon as they have dispatched the 
        Report which by the Warrant of his Royal Highness they are already ordered to
        make: provided they find the silver produced out of that Ore to be more then

        Memorial of the General of the Mint in Scotland for impresting upon account 2400li
to his Lordship out of the Coinage Duty as due for the service 
        of the said Mint for the two years ending at Christmas last 
        together with such further summ as your Lordships shall judge 
        necessary for bearing the charge of coinage, I humbly represent, 
        
        That be the   Act of Vnion  there was to be a Mint in Scotland conformable to the Mint in England, &
        by the  Act which passed in the first year of his Majesty for continuing the  former Acts for encouragement of coinage, your Lordships are impoured, out of the moneys arising in Great Brittain by the said Act to cause so much money to be  issued out of the  Exchequer to the Master of the Mint in England & to the General of the Mint in Scotland respectively by way of imprest & upon account  as shall be necessary for defraying the expences of the said Mints. And accordingly 1200
        
        the summ of 1200li has been already issued to  the General of that Mint  not as an Annuity due to the Mint but upon Account, & therefore an Account thereof should be certified to your Lordships in order to know what moneys are to be further imprest to his Lordship. That the standing salaries of the Officers of that Mint amount unto 930li per annum
        
        & therefore if 1000li per annum  towards the charges of coinage & of keeping the Offices in repair & the dwelling houses wind & water tite, & the ballance of the Account may be  certified into the Treasury annually in order to be paid off. There  is also a further salary of 50li per annum allowed to the Clerk of the Bullion untill his place becomes void he being an useless officer. And the Indenture of that Mint became void by the said late Act of Parliament in relation to the Masters Office  of receiving & paying & accounting. All which being considered  7amp; that by the Act of Vnion the  Mint in England is not altered & the Mint in Scotland ought to be conformable to that in England: I am humbly of opinion that  the money arising by the coinage Act in England be still imprest to the Master & Worker  of his Majesties Mint in the Tower by a Sign Manual as before 
        
         <102v> 
        
        the  union & in the same manner. And that out of the moneys arising by the coinage Act in great Britain so much be imprest from time to time upon account for the use & service of his Majesties mint at Edinburgh  by a like Sign Manual as shall be sufficient,  for the maintenance thereofso that the whole moneys   from time to time upon the same sign manual do not exceed a certain summ suppose t In the Mint in Scotland the salaries amount only to 980li per annum whereof 50li per annum is to cease at the death of the late Clerk of the Bullion:  & therefore 1200li per annum to that Mint without including the charge of coynage is too much. If to the 200li already in their hands 1800li more be added to make up the whole summ 3000 for the three years ending at Christmas last & the 1800li be imprest   for the use & service of that Mint in general so that it may be applicable to all sorts of charges: when the Account is made up  till Christmas last, & the ballance of the account is certified to your Lordships, it will then appear  to your Lordships what further  summ should be imprest. The  salaries of that Mint amount unto 980li per annum whereof 50li per annum is allowed to the late Clerk of the Bullion during   life & 50li per annum was added to the Wardens  salary  a little before the Vnion in consideration of services done to some of the Nobility of Scotland. And when these two fifty pounds cease the salaries will amount only to 880li per annum. And therefore an Annuity of twelve hundred pounds per annum without including the charge of coinage is too much. It may be sufficient at present to add 1800li  to the 1200li already imprest, so as to make the whole summ 3000li advanced for the three years ending at Christmas last. And when the Accounts shall be made up for those three years & a copy thereof sent to your Lordships,  it will then appear  to your Lordships what further summ should be imprest. But I am humbly of opinion that there should be a signe Manual – – – untill a new Indenture shall be made. And when that Mint shall be to a posture to coine, care may be taken that there be always a summ of money  (suppose of one,  two or three hundred pounds,) lodged in the Generals hands for bearing the charges thereof, & appropriated to that service; with direction that whenever that summ shall fall short, the charges of coinage be born out of any other moneys in the Generals hands untill  the deficiency can be made up All which &c  ✱ & the charge of  keeping the Officers in repair & the dwelling houses wind & waster tite can be but small. And that there may be no more complaints of the want of moneys to beare the charges of coynage, the General may have notice to pay those charges in the first place & let the deficiency (if there by any) fall upon the salaries. – wherein is set for{t}h that pursuant to the Acts of Parliament for  encouragement of coinage, moneys have been issued after the rate of 1200li  yearly for the service of the Mint in Scotland untill 1st Decem. 1714. And that  pursuant to an Act in the first session of this present Parliament  twelve hundred pounds more have been issued upon account  for one years service untill 1st Decem 1715 & 2400li more are due for the two years  ending 1st December last. I humbly represent that no moneys are due to that Mint by way of an Annuity.
        
         The standing salaries of that Mint amount unto 930li per annum, besides an allowance of 50li per annum to the Clerk of the Bullion  duuring life. And therefore 1200li per annum without including the charges of coinage, is too much.  It may be sufficient at present to add 1800li more to the 1200li allready imprest so as to make the whole summ 3000li for the three  years ending at Christmass last. And then the Accounts shall be made up  for those three years  & a copy thereof sent to your Lordships: it will then appear to your Lordships what further summs should  be imprest. But there  may be a signe manual now  sent to the General of th{a}t Mint impowering & directing him to pay the salaries to whom they  are or shall due by the Indenture of that Mint, & to pay off Bills of charges  examined by the  Master, Warden & Counterwarden & to make up his Accounts annually, & directing in their several Posts to take care that the moneys be duly coined & him & all the Officers to observe the Rules & Precepts set down in the Indenture of that Mint (except the alterations made by Parliament) untill a new Indenture shall be made.
             But considering that the General of that Mint is not  impowered by the Indenture of that Mint to pay any moneys, I am humbly of opinion that there should be a signe Manual sent to him impowering & directing him to pay the salaries & other expences to whom they are or shall become due by the said Indenture  & to make up his Accounts annually, & directing him & all the Officers in their several places to take care that the moneys be duly coined, & to observ{e} all the Rules & Precepts set down in the said Indenture  (except the alterations made by Parliament) untill a new Indenture shall be made. To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury.  May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference 
        upon the Memorial of the General of the Mint in Scotland 
        for impresting upon account  two thousand four 
        hundred pounds to his Lordship out of the coinage Duty as due 
        for the service of the said Mint for the two years ending 
        at Christmas last, together with such further summ as 
        your Lordships shall judg necessary for bearing the charge of 
        coinage; I humbly represent, that by the Act of Vnion the Mint in Scotland was to be conformable to the Mint in England, & by the Act which passed in the first year of his present Majesty for continuing the former Acts for the encouragement of coinage, your Lordships are impowered out of the moneys arising in 
        great Britain by the said Act, to cause so much money to be 
        issued out of the Exchequer to the Master of the Mint in 
        England & to the General of the Mint in Scotland respectively by way of imprest  & upon account, as shall be necessary for defraying the expenses of the said Mints, & 
        that all the moneys issued out of the Exchequer to his Majestys 
        Mint in England are pursuant to the Act of coynage imprest in general words for the use 
        & service of this Mint, so that they may be applied to the 
        charge of coynage as well as to any other charges of the 
        Mint. The salaries of the Officers of the Mint in Scotland amount 
        only to 980li per annum whereof 50li per annum is to cease at 
        the death of the late Clerk of the Bullion, & the charge of 
        keeping the Offices in repair & the dwelling houses of the 
        Officers wind & water tite, can be but small; & therefore 
        twelve hundred pounds per annum allowed to that Mint without 
        including the charge of coinage, is too much. If to the 1200li
already in their hands 1800li more be added to make up the 
        whole summ 3000li for the three years ending at Christmas 
        last, & the 1800li be imprest for the use & service of that 
        Mint in general, so that it may be applied to all sorts of 
        charges: the Account be made up till Christmas last, & the 
        ballance thereof certified to your Lordships in order to be considered 
        when the next moneys shall be imprest. And so on from time to time. And considering that the Indenture of that Mint doth not 
        
         <106r> 
        
        impower the General to pay any moneys, I am humbly of opinion that 
        there should be a Signe manual sent to him, impowering & directing 
        him to pay the salaries & other expences to whom they are or shall 
        become due by the said Indenture & to make up his accounts annually 
        & directing him & all the Officers in their several stations to take 
        care that the moneys be duly coined, & to observe all the Rules & 
        Precepts set down in the said Indenture (except the alterations made 
        by Parliament,) untill a new Indenture shall be made. And that there may be no more complaints of the want of 
        moneys to beare the charge of coynage, the General may have 
        notice to pay those charges in the first place & let the deficiency 
        (when ever there shall be any) fall upon the salaries.  All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordships great wisdome Is. Newton."

In consideration of the advantages which may accrue to the East India Company by this Act by lowering the price of Bullion & permitting the exportation of money &  for encouraging the importatio{n} of Gold & Silver in lieu of the great quantities exported by them & for or toward paying the charge of coyning so much as they shall export in  English coyn, they the said Company shall annually pay to the Master of the Mint at  his Office in the Tower of London upon the Feast of                      the summ of          thousand pounds.  2 For encouraging the Importation of Gold & Silver to be coyned in England  The East India Company to pay annually into the Custome house upon the Feast               or within  days after the summ of                thousand pounds    & in default of payment the said summ to be speedily seized in any of their ships by Warrant of the Commissioners of the Customes.  This summ        thousand pounds to be set apart with the Duties given for encouragement of coynage & paid into the Exchequer & thence to the Master of the Mint for the same uses. And  consideration of the said Annuity the East India company to pay but half the charge of  coyning what monies they export.  The law would encourage the Merchant to bring his Bullion from Spain to the Market in England rather then carry it directly to the Indies   where the coynage will cost at least twice as much as the exportation of money from England. And the more Bullion flows to our market the more money will stay with us, & the more will our coyn be propagated abroad to the honour of the nation. Proposals for preserving & encreasing  the Coyn of this Kingdome.  All gold & silver designed for exportation shall be examined & 
        entred in the Mint. And for that end all Ingots of gold & silver imported & all old Plate imported & designed for  exportation & all sand gold & virgin gold & virgin silver shall  upon its first coming 
        up the River of Thames to the Custome  house be brought to the 
        Mint by the Master of the ship &                  other witnesses 
        who shall  there shew their  Bill of lading & be examined about  the importation of the said Gold or Silver. And the said sand Gold & virgin gold &  virgin Silver & plate & all 
        forreign monies designed for  exportation shall be there melted 
        into Ingots. And these Ingots  & all other Ingots of gold & silver 
        above mentioned shall at  the choise of the Merchant be either 
        coyned into monies  or marked with a stamp provided for that purpose.  And the 
        Master of the Mint if desired shall give the Merchant  an indented Ticket certifying the weight of the monies  coyned out of the 
        said forreign gold or silver & the time of  the coynage thereof: 
        which Ticket shall be cut out of a book of the  Mint & entred in         the same book Ingots not markt with the Mint stamp may not be exported 
        nor bought or sold nor carried into any ship or boat but  may be brought to the Mint for encreasing the coyn of this kingdom. This law now obteins in France 
        by an edict of last  March for preventing the melting down of 
        the monies. The Merchant upon  delivering the Mint 
        Tickets at the  Custome house may within a year after the coynage 
        of the monies  mentioned therein, by Warrant of the Commissioners of the 
        Customes  upon a day appointed in the Warrant ship for exportation 
        the  said monies or the same weight of like monies or  any part thereof & also any 
        Ingots which have the Mint stamp  upon them & the Customer 
        shall enter the same & file the  Tickets. All silver monies before shipping for exportation shall pay 
        1d.12 per  ounce Troy at the Custome house for the charge of assaying 
         melting & coyning the same. And all gold monies shall 
        pay 612  per ounce. Which Duties shall be kept apart  with  the Duty 
        already granted for encouragement of coynage &  therewith paid 
        into the Exchequer & thence imprest to  the Master  of 
        the Mint for  the same uses. And all Ingots stampt shall  pay 
        
         <II.575r> 
        
        to the Master of  the Mint before stamping a farthing per  ounce of 
        silver & 1d per ounce of gold for defraying the charges  of the first 
        meltings & stamping & towards  the charges of assaying  melting & coyning 
        the monies & of providing & repairing things  necessary for  the same. For which Duty the 
        Master of the  Mint shall be answerable to  the King. No gold or silver (other then pocket money already  allowed) shall 
        be exported out of any other port of England then that of London nor 
        out of Ireland except into England. Felony without benefit of Clergy to counterfeit the Mint  stamp 
        or the Mint Tickets. And other penalties on them who  ship silver 
        not licensed or without paying the Duty or upon  any other day then 
        that appointed in the Warrant or buy or  sell unmarkt Ingots or 
        knowingly bring gold or silver to the Mint  to be markt or coynd as 
        forreign which is not forreign. Such a Law would enable the Officers of the Mint to understand the state of the Money with respect to trade. It would render 
        trade freer then at present. It would save the Merchant the trouble 
        &  charge of attending with his Bullion & witnesses at Goldsmiths Hall 
        and  Yeild Hall after he has melted it at the Refiners or Goldsmiths. 
        It  would cheque the melting down of our monies for exportation or for 
        sale to Goldsmiths much better then the laws do at present no ingots melted down in private being any longer {v}endible or exportable.
        & prevent the open or publick importation of  more 
        gold & silver then is imported.  It would bring down the price of 
        Bullion nearer to a par with  money & thereby make the money less liable to be melted down  into Bullion. It would increase the coynage 
        by bringing all gold &  silver through the Mint & laying on that which is 
        not coyned a  small Duty to pay for the first meltings: for which Duty there is 
        a precedent in Holland. It would decrease the Indian manufacture  of 
        coyning our Bullion in Ports where the Company have not a Mint  of their 
        own, for which coynage the Indians receive of us a large  seigniorage. 
        It would be profitable to the Merchant by the use  of his gold & silver 
        when turned into money  till exportation. I would  encrease our coyn 
        as well by the Merchants money running amongst us  till exportation 
        as by what is not exported within the year. It would be  of great 
        credit to the nation by the Merchants exporting their Gold & Silver 
        in the form of English money to be current in forreign nations,       
         and thereby would make us appear abroad more rich & potent then we do at 
        present. And  all this would be done without any new charge to the 
        Government. Proposals for preserving & encreasing the current coyn of this Kingdom.  It being the business of the Officers of the Mint to preserve & encrease the coyn of this kingdom & for that end it being fit that they should understand the course of trade in relation to the importation & exportation of gold & silver by the Merchant,  & be able upon occasions to give an account thereof to the government. It is proposed that no gold or silver (except pieces of 8) be exported but what has been first brought to the Mint & there examined & allowed to be forreig{n} gold or silver & entred as such & at the choise of the  Merchant either coyned or marked in the Ingot with a mark provided for that purpose.

But  no Ingots besides Spanish barrs shall be received at the Mint as forreign silver Proposals for preserving & encreasing the coyn of this kingdom without hindring the freedom of Trade.  For preventing the exportation of more Gold & Silver then is imported.  Vpon arrival of every merchant ship a Custome house Officer to take an account of all Gold & Silver imported therein & enter the same with the exact weight of every species thereof in a Book for that purpose & give the Merchant an indented Ticket conteining a copy of the said entry cut out from the said Book & to stamp all the Barrs or Ingots with a stamp for that purpose. All this he shall do gratis. If the Merchant within one year after the date of the said entry or Ticket shall bring the said Gold or Silver or any part thereof to the Mint to be coyned the Master of the Mint or his Deputy shall gratis enter on the backside of the said Ticket the Species gross weight & standard weight of the Gold or silver so brought in & coyned. And upon delivering back the said Ticket at the Custome-house, the Merchant or his Assignes may within one year after the Date thereof export the uncoyned Gold or Silver mentioned therein or any part thereof together with any summ of English money not exceeding the standard weight endorsed; paying the charge of coyning the money exported. Which payment shall be kept apart with the Duty granted by Act of Parliament for encouragement of Coynage & together with it be paid into the Exchequer & thence imprest to the Master of the Mint for the same uses. The Ticket so delivered back to be filed in the Custome house & the Exportation entred there with the species & weight of the exported Gold & Silver coynd & uncoyned. And if all the Gold or Silver mentioned in the said Ticket be not exported the remainder to be entred & the Merchant to have gratis a new indented Ticket of the first date for the same. And also for so much as he exports to have gratis a License under the hands of four Commissioners of the Customes. No gold or silver to be exported in Barrs or Ingots or molten masses which have not the Custome house mark upon them, & to counterfeit that mark shall be felony. A penalty for impressing that mark upon other gold or silver then such as shall be found in the ship at its first arrival or exporting Gold or Silver coynd or uncoynd without License or shipping the same for exportation. No gold or silver to be exported out of Ireland unless into England upon pain of               And an account of all the Gold & Silver exported thence into England to be sent monthly from the Custom house in Dublin to that in London that the Officers here may enquire after it. The Commissioners of the Customes to take annually an Account of all the Gold & Silver imported & exported in all our ports & copies of the summs of every species imported from & exported to every place to be sent to the Treasury the Council of Trade & the Mint. This last might be done by order of Treasury the rest by Act of Parliament.  Such a Law would render Trade free, even freer then 
        in Holland when Bullion exported pays to their Mint. It would 
        save the Merchant the trouble &  charge of attending at Goldsmiths 
        Hall with his Bullion which discourages him from importing it. It would 
        secure us from the exportation of more Gold & Silver then we 
        import much better then we are now secured by Custom house oaths{.}
It  would put an end to the melting down of our money for exportation & exporting it by false oaths. It would raise the price of money above that of Bullion as it ought to be by reason of the workmanship, & this would incline the Goldsmith to make plate of Bullion rather then of money & the Merchant to increase our coyn by turning his Bullion into money contrary to what is done at present by reason of the great price of Bullion. It would be profitable to the Merchant by thus lowering the price of Bullion & also by the use of his Gold & Silver when turned into money. It would increase our coyn as well by the Merchants money running amongst us till exportation as by what is not exported within the year. And it would be of great credit to the nation by the Merchants exporting their Gold & Silver in the form of English money to be current in forreign nations. For this would make us appear to them more rich & potent then we do at present & thereby recommend & encourage our Ministers & Merchants in Treaties & Trade. All this would be done without any new charge to the Government. Proposals for encreasing the Coyn of this Kingdome.  The use of Gold & Silver in Cloaths Coaches and Houshold furniture was forbid in France last March. If such a law here should be thought too general it might suffice to forbid the use of gold & silver in lace and fringes & the guilding upon leather wood plaister or any other material then standard silver or silver finer then standard, except such pieces of work of any material as cost not above      a piece for guilding.  All persons going to sea are allowed without any restraint to carry on board what place they please for their own use, by which means our money being run down into plate may be freely exported and Luxury is encouraged in the Royal Navy, it growing into fashion for the Officers to have great quantities of Plate on board. The working Goldsmiths have been busy in making small Vessels & Vtensils ever since the recoynage of the hammered money. Their material is the remainder of that money which still flows out of the country & it may be suspected that a good part of their work has been exported, even without the allowance of the Commissioners of the Customes by an Act of an 9 or 10 of his present  Majestys  are empowerd to license the exportation of Plate. There wants a law to restrain this mischief, & to prohibit the exportation of Plate whose workmanship is of small value in proportion to that of the metal, it being more profitable to export such plate to the Indies then to any place in Europe. In France the laws for a long time have forbidden certain Vessels & Vtensils to be made of gold & silver & others to be made of those metals of above certain weights. Particularly  Vessels  for the use of the Table  must not be of gold & other vessels of gold must not exceed an ounce in weight. Also Ballisters, Cabinets Tables, Bureaus, Looking-glasses, Andirons, Grates, Ornaments of the fire or Chimney, Candlesticks with branches &c must not be of silver. Basins of silver must not exceed the weight of twelve Marks, Platters not of eight, trencher plates not of 24 marks the douzen &c. Such limitations here for manufactured gold & silver would encrease our money. The like limitations  for China earthen ware would save the Nation much money and so would a prohibition of importing Cabinets & other laquered wooden ware from Iapan & other parts of the Indies. For These things serves for nothing but an useless & expensive sort of luxury maintained by the exportation of our  gold & silver to the Indies. The increase of our coyn is principally hindred by the East Indian Company's buying up the imported Bullion & sending it to the Indies without being obliged to export a proportional quantity of English Commodities. The old Company is obliged by Patent to export 100'000li per annum in Commodities but the Obligation is expiring and perhaps was never well observed & the Cargo in Gold & Silver is unlimited in proportion to that in goods. If the Companies were obliged to export one third part or rather half as much in Commodities as in gold and silver it would conduce very much to the exportation of our own manufactures & native product and cheque the exportation of gold & silver & thereby bring down the high price of Bullion which occasions the melting down of our money. Such a law might put the East India Merchants to some difficulties for a while but in a short time would force their trade into better channels. For Merchants would soon find out new ways of vending their goods in China & other places whereby their trade would become much more profitable to the nation. and tho it might not be so profitable to the Merchant as at present yet it would be more creditable & secure. For the vast exportation of silver to the Indies hath brought the Company into such an ill repute as may end in their ruin if it be not remedied. I would therefore propose that in lading any Merchant ship no gold or silver be put on board till she hath her lading of other commodities & then on a day appointed by the  Commissioners of the Customes, twice as much gold & silver in value may be put on board as the Bill of lading in those other Commodities amounts unto. And if any ship bound to the Indies want of her lading in Gold & Silver the defect or remainder may be carried on board the next ship or ships of the same Merchant or Company provided it be done within          months after the lading of the former ship. But no ship should exceed her just lading in Gold & Silver except in making up the defect of a former ship. No ship bound to the Indies should take in any gold or silver after her lading at the Port of London. The importing of stained Callicoes is prohibited in England & France and the staining of them is prohibited in France but not yet in England.

In consideration of the advantages accruing to the East India Company by this Act by lowering the price of Bullion & permitting the exportation of money, & for encouraging the importation gold & silver in lieu of the great quantities exported by them they the said Company shall annually pay into the Custome house upon the Feast of — the summ of

And upon any doubt, the Assaymaster of the Mint to assay the same at the Charge of the Merchant. Such an Act would be for the advantage of the Merchant by the use of his Gold & Silver when turned into money. It would save him the trouble & charge of attending with it at Goldsmiths Hall. It would leave trade free even freer then in Holland where the Merchant pays to the Mint for what he exports. It would  put an end to the perjury of such as now export by fals oaths & much better then by oaths prevent the melting down of our money for exportation by which the nation loses the charge of coynage. It would increase our coyne by the merchants money  till exportation & also by what is not exported within 2 months.  It would be of great credit to the nation by the Merchants exporting their Gold & Silver in the form of English money to be current in forreign nations. For this would make us appear to them more rich & potent then we do at present  Such a Law would render Trade perfectly free even freer then in 
        Holland when Bullion exported pays to their Mint. It would save the 
        Merchant the trouble &  charge of attending at Gold Hall & Goldsmiths Hall with his

        secure us from the exportation of more Gold & Silver then we import 
        much better then we are now secured by Custom house oaths. It would put an end to
        the melting down of our silver for exportation

And so would a general prohibition of importing Iapan wooden ware  The importation of stained Callicoes is prohibited, but they are stained in England & thereby the importation of plain Callicoes is encreased. The staining of them is prohibited in France Quære whether the want of stained Callicoes would not cost England more money in other commodities?  I have head that in France the Est India Merchants are enjoyned to export half as much in French commodities as in gold & silver. Such a law in England would promote the exportation of our own manufacture & diminish the exportation of gold & silver & thereby bring down the high price of Bullion which occasions the melting down of our money.  Such a law would  put the  East India Merchants to some difficulties for a while but in a short time would force their Trade into new Channels more to the nations advantage (though perhaps less to the Merchants) then those it runs in at present.

        freer then at present. It would save the Merchant the trouble &  charge 
        of attending with his Bullion & Witnesses at Goldsmiths Hall &  Yeild Hall 
        after he has melted it at the Refiners or Goldsmiths. It  would prevent 
        the melting down of our monies for exportation  or for  sale to 
        Goldsmiths much better then the laws do at present, no ingots cast in private
        being any longer exportable or vendible. It would decrease the Indian Manufacture of coyning our Bullion in Ports of India where the Company have not a Mint  
        of their own, for which coynage the Indians receive of us a large  seigniorage
        at discretion. It would be profitable to the Merchant by the use  of his silver when 
        turned into money till exportation. It would  encrease our coyn as well by the 
        Merchants money running amongst us  till exportation as by what is not 
        exported within the year. It would be  of great credit to the nation by the 
        Merchants exporting their  silver in the form of English money 
        to be current in forreign nations & thereby  make us appear 
        abroad more rich & potent then we do at present. And  all this without 
            any new charge to the Government."

An the like quantity was consigned to him Iune 8th 1705 on the same terms. The first parcel was sold in about 15 months, the second (by openiong a trade over the Rhene into France) in 9 or 10 months. And both parcels produced by the sale 63014li clear of interest & all other charges except the duty of 3s per wt. Which produce is after the rate of 3li 17s 134d per wt. Part of which money came in some time after the sale. Mr Stratford &  Mr Free Feb. 20, 17045 had 250 Tunns of Tin consiged to Hamburgh upon the like terms & upon notice of its arrival at Hamburgh advanced 12000li ipon it at 4 per cent. Sixteen blocks were lost by an unsolvent chapman & the rest produced 19286li 11s 9d clear of  interest & all other charges except the duty of 3s per wt: which produce is after the rate of 3.li 19.s 112d per  weight. Part of which money came in late. The present Commissions to sell when the time comes are less advantageous then the former. There is no lowest price set. They interrupt the course of payments. And by the great quantity of Tin lying abroad put a damp upon the markets till the sale begins. A merchant may have Tin here for 3li 19s per  including the Duty, & ship it off for 6d per  or less & will scarce reccon the  carrying it to Hamborough at above 6d per . The Duty there & housing may be also 6d & the interest of the price till it arrives at Hamburgh 3d more. Tin therefore stands the merchant in about 4li. 0s. 9d at Hamborough.   And if her Majesty  should sell it there to the Merchant   for ready money  at a set price, something must be abated of 4l. 0s. 9d to incline him to buy at Hamborough rather then at London. If 4li per  should be the price & the charges of an Office for selling it, which would scarce  be less then 1s 6d per ,  be deducted, the Queen will receive but 3li 18s 0d or 3{li} 18{s} 6{d} per & & this without having any part of the money advanced. If Mr Stratford & partners will give after the rate of 4li per   & within one month after the consignement of every 100 Tuns for sale advance the full price of 8000li: the bargain (considering that it will revive the market & diminish the Tin abroad & bring in more money to her Majesty & that her Majesty runs no risque of selling 
         <504v> 
    upon trust nor stay for any part of the money till debts can be got in;) will be much more advantageous then any of the Commissions above mentioned besides the duty of 3s per  saved to her Majesty  < text from f 504v resumes > 

        And to take 100 Tunns at a time & pay {here} within a month is better by four or five months 
            
             < insertion from the top of f 504r > interest of the money then to take only 10 or 20 Tunns at a time for ready money at Hamborough:  And therefore this bargain would be 3 or 4s per  better then to set up an Office for sale.

Mr Stratford will not disable other Merchants from sending Tin to that Market if they can get by it: & a high price (which is the  fault of a monopoly) would invite them thither.  He will be enabled to undersell other Merchants by about 9d in the  (which would promote the sale) but not to raise the price of the market. He reccons that he can sell 200 Tunns per annum, & that market usually takes of  about 220.

Till the reign of Henry II Ireland was divided amongst many Kings & Lords without any common Parliament. Then one of those Kings vizt Dermot Prince of Leinster, being beaten by his neighbours obteined succours of some English Lords by the consent of King Henry II who was then busied in Aquitain, & by their assistance recovered his territories. And a little after vizt in November 1172 King Henry went into Ireland with an Army, & the Kings Lords & Prelates of Ireland being terrified by the late successes of the English arms submitted & swear fealty & homage to the King & confirmed the kingdome of Ireland to him & his Heirs by Letters with seales pendent after the manner of Charters. And thereupon the King convening the Irish at Lismore caused them to receive the Laws of England & to swear to be governed thereby, & in like manner calling a Council of the Irish Clergy at Cashal he made them promis conformity to the English Church, & in April following vizt 1173 returned into England. Molyn. p. 6, 7, 9, 9, 10, 11, 12, 28, 36, 37. About five years after in a Parliament held at Oxford the King created his younger son Iohn then 12 years old, Lord of Ireland & at his death left the Kingdom of England to his elder son Richard I but by the death of Richard & succession of Iohn the Lordship of Ireland became again united to the Crown of England,  & hath ever since continued so. Mol. p. 39, 40, 43. King Iohn about the 12th year of his reign over England vizt Iun 28 1210 went into Ireland & the Irish Princes being affrighted did him homage & fealty & he granted & enjoyned them the English Laws & Customes by a Charter or Statute under his Seale swearing them thereunto & placing Sheriffs & other Ministers who might judge the Irish according to those Laws. Whence they have to this day Courts of Chancery, Kings Bench, Commons Please & Exchequer as in England. Afterwards Henry III the son & successor of King Iohn in the 12t year of his reign sent a Mandate to Richard de Burgh then Iustice of Ireland to conve{ne} the Irish & cause to be read to them the Charter or Statute which his Father King Iohn had ordeined & caused them swear unto concerning the Laws & Customes of England to be observed in Ireland & that he should cause the Irish firmly to receive & keep the said Laws & Customs & the same to be proclaimed & obeyed in every County of Ireland forbidding in the Kings name that no man pres{illeg}e to act contrary to this his Mandate. Mol. p. 44, 52. The words of the Mandate run thus.

Regn. nostri 12. Mol. p. 53. Thus did the Kings of England in these Reigns by their absolute & sole authority as Conquerors impose Laws on Ireland even without a Parliament, the Irish hitherto assembling not to make laws but to submit & swear to the laws on them by the Kings command. And therefore the present Irish Parliament is of no further authority then what it derives from the grant of the Crown of England & by consequence of no authority against an Act of an English Parliament. Some would derive the Parliament of Ireland from a Grant of Hen. II called Modus tenendi Parliamentum, but this is of suspected authority. King Iohn & Henry III seem the first who granted Charters & Privileges to Ireland. Edward I neare the beginning of his reign summoned them by Writs to the Parliament of England & these summons continued till towards the end of the reign of Edward III or longer. p. 95, 96, 97. Whence the Lordship of Ireland was as much annexed & united by law to the crown & Kingdom of England as  the Principality of Wales is at present. For Ireland is so firmly annexed to the crown of England (even by Acts of Parliament of both nations & particularly by Poynings Act) that whoever is King  of England is ipso facto Lord or King of Ireland p 43, 44, 127. Whence Acts of an English Parliament for setling the succession to the crown are of force in Ireland without the authority of an Irish Parliament & an Irish Act of settlement can be no more then declarative for publishing & putting in execution the Law of England & must derive its authority from that Law. And for the same reason an English Parliament has power to impose laws on Ireland for preventing or suppressing rebellions & conserving the possession of Ireland to this Crown. When the Irish had seen the manner of Parliaments in England the King began to summon them at home, & Edward III granted them Councils & Parliaments by his Letters Patents confirmed afterward by  Rich II, p. 161, 162, 163. These Parliaments examined the English statutes not yet imposed on the Kingdom by Royal authority & by degrees received them all till the 10th year of Henry VII p. 64, 68, 69. At which time their Parliaments by Poynings Act gaining a negative voice to the Kings broad
        
         <457r> 
        
        seal (p. 160, 161, 166, 167)) they began to make their private Statutes with less regard to ours, & in the next reign aspired from the title of a Lordship to that of a kingdom. However, in memory of their ancient subjection to our laws, their Courts of Iustice remain to this day subordinate to ours. For a writ of error still lies from the Kings Bench of Ireland to the Kings Bench of England & thereby the Iudges of our Kings Bench are Interpreters of all the Irish Laws. For we are to judge them by their own Laws whether those Laws were received from us or made originally in their own Parliament. And since a writ of Error lies from our Kings Bench to our House of Lords, this House & much more the King & both Houses together are Interpreters of all the Irish  Laws p 71, 87, 88, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 139. So then it lies in the breast of an English Parliament to interpret & declare the meaning extent & force of all the Irish Laws not excepting those by which they claim any power to themselves."

        purpose for restraining of which a Law might be usefull against 
        Exporting any Ingots of Silver melted down in England except 
        in a publick office to be appointed or erected for that 
        purpose. The Law by barring the Exportation of forreign Silver 
        after it is Coyned prevents the Coynage thereof because the 
        Merchant Cannot afterward export it & tends to discourage the 
        bringing of Silver into England because the Merchant can 
        make no use of it whilst it stays here in the form of Bullion 
        the bringing of Silver to the Market of England and the 
        turning it into monies should rather be encouraged as 
        the proper means of encreasing the coyn,  Silver being more apt to stay with us 
        in the useful form of money then in the useless form of 
        Bullion and encreasing the Coyn whilst it stays with us If the merchant might export what he coyns  some part of what he coyns would be apt to be laid out here. And 
        this Liberty may be allowed him after some such manner 
        as is Expressed in the Scheme hereunto annexed The Licensing the exportation of Bullion 
        whilst the exportation of the money is prohibited makes silver 
        worth more uncoyned then coyned and thereby not only stops the 
        Coynage but causes the melting down of the money in private 
        for exportation. For remedying this mischief it may be perhaps 
        better on the contrary to prohibite the exportation of Bullion 
        and License that of money and when ever the money is in 
        danger, to Licence the exportation of so much money only 
        as shall be coyned from time to time out of forreign Bullion"

          If his Majesty upon the considerations above mentioned shall please to restore him to his Place of Assistant to the Surveyor of the meltings  which his former salary of 50li per annum either during pleasure or for life it may be done by a Warrant under a signe manual. And if his Majesty shall please also to lay this further duty upon him to keep an Account of all the Coynage Duty arising in Scotland & to pay to receive & pay the same or take case that the same be paid into his Majestys Exchequer as it ought to be by Act of Parliament, his Office will be usefull.

But  something may be abated of this price upon these considerations. 1 The Pewterers who factor for forreign merchants  in small parcells, can  frequently get
such parcells to be taken into ships  which want ballast, & so save the freight. 2 Though 1 per cent be very low insurance yet  Merchants chuse rather to risque it, & will have more reason to do so in times of peace. 3 The merchants for whom the Pewterers factor being generally forreigners, theose that are of Amsterdam can more easily procure favour for themselves in the valuation & premium then Englishmen can do for her Majesty. 4 The Pewterers  sell to forreigners upon trust  An Account of the charges of selling Tin in Amsterdam at 45  Gilders per 100 weight Dutch.

Total Charge of exporting Total charge Therefore the Tyn to reimburse all the charges & hazzards should be sold in Holland for 46 Gilders 7 stivers per  100 Dutch weight Observations The Pewterers in London factor upon trust for their correspondents in Holland & 
        some other places, in small parcells of 10 20  30 or 40 blocks in a parcel 
        & find it no very difficult matter to meet with ships which want  convenient ballast & 
        the people for whom they factor commonly act  for themselves in their own
            houses shops & warehouses without the charges of commission & brokerage  & making 
        three or four returns in a year content themselves with a small profit of 
        one or two per cent in each return, &  chuse rather to risque it then 
        be at the charge of ensuring. And the Pewterers sorting the Tin
 
        
         <III.501v> 
        
         make some advantage of the grain Tin  whereby they can afford to trust & forbear their correspondents abroad. And English Merchants seldom send Tynn into Holland not finding their Account in selling it there by commission.
         2. By the above written Account  it woul be almost equal to  a Merchant of Amsterdam to give 3li 16s per  Averdupois at the Tower or 43G 18st per 100 Dutch weight at 
        Amsterdam paying in ready money, & her Majesty bearing the extraordinary charges of 
        her Office & Warehouse room at Amsterdam & of the city weighhouse. I say almost equal, because the 
        Merchant would  desire to save the freight, &  chuse to risque it, 
        especially in times of peace
     3. Considerable quantities of Tin are sent hence to Roterdam & Bruges 
            & unless something be allowed for the charges of getting it thither from 
            Amsterdam they will still  have it from London. 5.  When Mr Drummond first proposed  to sell Tin by Commission 
         for her Majesty he represented that the price had then been from 45 
        to 47 Gilders:  The late Lord Treasurer put the price at 4412, & Mr Drummond 
        by that price had the whole trade of Holland.  
        This being compared with the Accounts & considerations above written it seems to me that at 4412 Gilders Mrs Moulaneers & sons will have the whole market  of Holland at 45 Gilders he  may have almost the whole market, at 46 he will lost half the market, at 47 he will sell very little. But in a paper of some
             late sales of Sir H. Furnase they were from 
        4414 to 45 which is lower then in the memorial of Mr Drummond. 4. In the Tower the buyer take the Tyn as it comes to hand without culling. In Holland the buyer is allowed to cull. And this makes the Tin of  more value & readier sale before sulling then afterward.   By the above written Account the Merchant can have Tynn housed at Amsterdam for 43 Gilders 18st  besides 14 styvers charges of returning the money.  And this puts the price at 44 Gilders 3 styvers in ready money. Add for prompt payment, ,lb/>ensurance of the payments, & two months interest, 1 Gilder 4st & the price at Amsterdam will be 45 Gilders 7 styvers.   But the Merchant would  chuse rather to  buy at London  
        then pay freight & averige & to risque it then allow 1 per cent insurance at sea especially in times of peace. For which reasons the 7 styvers may be abated. An Account of the costs & charges of procuring Tynn from London & housing it at Amsterdam.  Paid in London per  English Paid in Holland per 100wt Dutch.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of the 19th instant upon Mr Drummonds Letter wherein he proposes that upon the receipt of 400 Tunns of Tin at Amsterdam or within 14 days after, he will there pay to your Lordships Order 4 pounds sterling per , which is 32000 pounds sterling in all, at the rate of 10 Gilders 10 stivers per pound, rebating 4 per cent for paying ready money; the freight, duty in Holland & all other charges after it is once on board, to be for his account: We humbly represent to your Lordship that the Tin put on board will stand her Majesty in 4li per , vizt 3li 16s the price sold at here, 3s custome & one shilling petty charge for shipping it. And that a rebate of two per cent  seems to us a sufficient recompence for paying ready money. For since Mr Drummond has sold 400 Tunns of Tinn in ten months as he represents in his Letter; if we should sell the like quantity in the Tower in that time in small parcells for ready money either to him or to other Merchants trading to Holland; the Tin being constantly selling would produce some of the money every day & half of it in half that time: which would be as advantageous to her Majesty as if we were to receive the price of the whole at once in the middle of that time And therefore her Majesty should allow interest for so much time only as she receives the money before the end of the five months next ensuing the delivery of the Tin: which interest  in Mr Drummonds case 
        
        will scarce exceed two per cent.  And so the four per cent which he demands is about two per cent too much. And since he proposes to pay for the Tin upon its arrival at Amsterdam her Majesty runs a risque at sea which Merchants reccon at two per cent. So that her Majesty
        
         <563v> 
        
        by this contract would lose 2 per cent interest & 2 per cent insurance, in all 4 per cent: which is above 3s per  & in the whole price of 32000li amounts to 1280li. And there may be a further loss as great by paying the money in Holland at 10 Gilders 10 stiver per pound sterling,  the Exchange at present being there at 11 Gilders per pound sterling, as we heare from Merchants. And we further lay before your Lordship that the former contracts have hitherto discouraged all other Merchants from exporting Tin into Holland; who, as we are very credibly informed, are ready to export it thither in good quantities so soon as Trade shall be left free. All which is most humbly submitted to your Lordship great Wisdome. & 1 per cent preference which he demands  in the exchange, in all, 514 per cent, which is about 4s 2d per wt, & in the whole price of 32000li amounts to 1680li sterling.  
        He proposes to pay only 10 Gilders 10 stivers for 1lib sterling, which is  about 212 below the  present course of exchange at Amsterdam, so that 
        
        if the Tin were now on board, his preference in this course  which he reccons 1 per cent might prove 2 or 212 per cent. And we further lay before your Lordship that  heretofore in times of peace Holland & Flanders have taken off about     Tuns of Tin per annum besides what has been sent into France,  that  in the first year of the present contract with the stannaries & most part of the second year the Pewterers supplied Holland with their own Tin  & as their stock of Tin has consumed, the sale of her Majestys tin has mended; that it has mended this last year as well in the Tower as in Holland & that the  late contracts with Mr Drummond have hitherto discouraged all other Merchants  from exporting Tin into Holland  who  as we are very credibly informed are ready to export it thither in good quantities so soon as {the preference  ceases. they can do it upon equal terms. In obedience to your Lordships order of Reference of the 19th instant upon Mr Drummonds letter wherein he proposes  that upon the receipt of 400 Tunns of Tin at Amsterdam or within 14 days after he will there pay  4 pound sterling per  which is 32000 poudns sterling in all, at the rate of 10 Gilders 10 stivers per pound,  rebating 4 per cent for paying  ready money; the freight, duly in Holland & all other charges after it is once on board to be for his account. We humbly represent  to your Lordship that the Tin put on board will stand her Majesty in  4li per  viz 3li. 16s the price sold at here, 3s custome & one shilling petty charges for shipping it.  And that  the payment of this money   within 14 days after the arrival of the Tin at Amsterdam at 10 Gilders 10st per pound with a rebate of 4 per cent  is  equipollent to the giving him  time till the  tinn arrives at Amsterdam & for a yeaar & 14 days longer besides the hazzards of the sea & besides the lowness of the exchange at which he proposes to pay the money. All which  renders the  contract  manifestly disadvantageous to her Majesty. For  since Mr Drummond has sold 400 Tunns of Tin in  10 months as he represents in his Letter if  we should sell the like quantity in the Tower  in that time i small parcels for ready money either to him r to other Merchants trading to Holland ‡
         ‡ the Tin being constantly selling would produce some of the money every day & about half of it in half the time of sale  which  would be as advantageous as if we were to receive the price of the whole at once in the middle of the tim of sale  
            & this without any hazzard at sea or loss by exchange. For the use of one half of the money received by parcels in the first five months  
                would recompence the want of the use of the other half to be received in like parcels in the last five months Whence  we humbly conceive that Mr Drummond should upon an equal contract be allowed interest only for five months dated from the delivery of the Tin at  the Tower, or rather for so much of the five months as remain when he pays the money: which interest will exceed two per cent. And therefore the 4 per cent which he demands is about two per cent too much, besides  the risque of the sea which by his proposing to pay for the Tin upon its arrival at Amsterdam, he seems to place upon her Majestys account, & which Merchants reccon at two per cent 
        so that her Majesty  by this contract would lose 2 per cent interest & 2 per cent insurance in all four per cent which in the whole price of 3200li amounts to 1280li, besides a further loss which may  prove as great by  paying the money in Holland at 10G 10st per  pound sterling, which at present is there at 11 Gilders per pound sterling as we {heare} from Merchants. 1034 G for 20s. 1 G = 20 St. 1 st = 16 dr. 5 G = 9 shillings. 100 G = 9li sterl. 37127 SS = 1li sterl. 33313 SS = 9li = 80s

And that if the Petitioner pleases to pay ready money for 400 or 450 Tunns of Tin & export it at his own charge  her Majesty should allow him all the advantage of the adventure; & for his further encouragement & in consideration of his paying ready money for so much tin at once, should also abate him 2s  per  in the price.

They may be also restrained from dispersing them before a specimen of them has been shewed to your Lordship or your Order or even from making medals  relating to state affairs or be otherwise limited as her Majesty shall think fit. And when  ever the Government pleases to    order the the coynage of a Medal I am ready to coyn it according to the course of the Mint as in the case of coronation Medals & to deliver any number of such Medals to your Lordships Order. 
    
    
        
        But to alter the course of the Mint  or to place in the Mint an arbitrary power of coyning Medals, or to give  to any Medals not approved by the Government the credit of being coyned by the Mint may have {bad} consequences,  & I humbly conceive its better that  the Gravers  Privilege be taken away, & the coynage of Medals left to the course of the Mint The Gravers of the Mint do hereby give notice that their privilege of making Medals  being no part of the constitution of the Mint;  they will for the future set their names or the first letters thereof upon all their own Medals to distinguish them from Medals made by the  Mint But should the Course oof the Mint be allowed by making the Gravers P{rivilege} a part of the constitution or  But whether the Coynage or Medals for hte future shall be in the Gravers or in the Mint  &  with what restrictions is humbly s{u}"

This said Robt: Newton, Minor, is kept out of his Estate by two Daughters, of his Fathers Eldest Brother, & tho there was a good Settlement made att the Marriage of his Grandmother, on the Male heirs, yet his uncles two Daughters pretend there has been fines past, and that their Father & Grand Mother by Lease & Release, has created it fee simple, but this said Robt: Newtons Father who was next in the intail, was not taken in, He was Minister of St Peters Church in this Citty of Chester, When he dyed, he left 5 young Children, the Eldest, but 12 years old, and this present youth, then 4 months Old, their Mother, through her great care and industry, gave them all, a good Edducation, the Eldest son, Chosen fellow, of Brazon Noze Oxen, and took his Master of Arts degree, he afterward, was Reader of St Stephens Walbrook London. In the year 1720 he preferred a Bill in Chancery against the two Daughters of his Vnckle, & continued in suit near two years, but finding his Mothers substance Exausted, & not able to proceed dismissed his bill, and soon after dyed, and ever since his death, 
         <11v> the two daughters are cutting down the Wood & makeing great devastation in the Estate, as appears by the Oaths of Creddible Persons, Sir Isack my years & Eyes will not permitt me to write, what may be said on this terrible case, but as Iustice & conscience, are the motives of troubling you, I hope it may Excuse me, as I am with great Respect, Sir Isack, Your most humble servant Geo: Needham Sir Isack Newton att his house near Leisterfeilds London May it please your Lordships In obedience to your Lordships Order of Referent of Sept. 23d, 1725, that we should cause the weight & assay of five sorts of  new Portugal Gold coins to be taken & report the same to your Lordships with our opinion at what value they may reasonably go in Ireland in case his Majesty should think fit to make them current there by proclamation: We have  caused five pieces of the said five sorts  new out of the Portugal Mint, to be  weighed & assayed. And they proved as follows By these assays the coyn is standard & by the weights of the pieces, the species are  double to one another in proportion, so that if the biggest pieces be  {valued} at three pounds eleven shillings & eight pence (as we reccon{)}; the next in bigness will be worth one pound eleven pence, the least but one nine shillings abating an half penny & the least four shillings & six pence abating a farthing. These are their  values in England when they come  fresh out of the Mint one with another but the Merchants will be apt to pick out the lightest pieces  for Ireland & send the heaviest to the melting pot. And those pieces which are full weight when they come fresh out of the Mint, will soon grow lighter by wearing  in Portugal before they come into Ireland. And the smallest pieces will wear fastest in proportion to their weight & value.  But if this money is to be made current in Ireland, we are humbly of opinion that   the biggest pieces should not be current for more then the value of three Guineas & a third part of a Guinea in Ireland,  the next in bignes may be current for half the value of the biggest, the middlemost for a quarter of that value, the least but one for the eighth part of that value & the least for the sixteenth part thereof. All which is most humbly submitted The pieces of the biggest species we reccon worth 3li. 11s. 8d  each as they come fresh out of the Mint,  one with another; & according to this valuation the next in bigness are worth one pound 15s & ten pence  each, the middlesmost are worth 17s. 11d each, the least but one are worth nine shilling  each abated an halfpenny, & the least are worth four shillings & six pence each abating a farthing. The Two thousand three hundred days are the duration of the profanation of the {temple}. & intermission of the {daily sacrifice} & amount unto six years & four months & twenty days: whereas the profanation of the tem{ple} &  cessation of the daily sacrifice in the reign of Antiochus lasted but three years 1 Maccab. 1. 20, 20, 54. And if you date the time from the first spoiling of the temple by Antiochus, which was two years earlier, the whole will be but five years, & these not continued. But if you date them from the time in which some Iews  apostatized from the law to the religion of the heathens & got a licence from the king to do after the ordinances of the heathens, &  built a place at Ierusalem for their religious meetings {Mac 1 11, 13, 14}: the year of this apostacy is not recorded, & it was but a particular apostacy without profaning the Temple or interrupting the daily sacrifice during 2300 days.  He only polluted the temple & took away the daly sacrifice during three years or 1080 days. MAccab. 1. 28, 29, 54 He spoiled the temple two years before but did not then take away the daily sacrific{e} & the whole five years amount only to 1800 days. Before this some Iews apostatized from the  laws to the heathen religion & got a licence from the king to do after the ordinances of the heathens & built a place at Ierusalem for their religious meetings Maccabi 1. 1.. 12. 14, but they neither cast down the sanctuary nor polluted it not took away the daily sacrifice. The  little horn acted till the last end of the indignation & this indignation is not yet at an end. The sanctuary continued cast down 2300 days before it was cleansed, & day, in sacred prophets are pu{illeg} for years. Ezek IV, 5, 6."

May it please your Lordship In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to me by Mr Taylour in his Letter of Iune 16th Instant, I have perused the Representation from the Lords of the Privy Council of Ireland touching a late Order of Council here for giving currency in that Kingdom by Proclamation to some forreign coins which were omitted in a former Proclamation, a printed copy of which they have sent desiring a clause to be added to the said Order for making such allowance for light pieces as was made in the said Proclamation, & that the Order may comprehend also the forreign coins mentioned in that printed Proclamation because the original thereof under the broad seal was destroyed in the late fire which happened there at the Council Chamber, so that the Clerk of the Council cannot now certify that the printed copy agrees verbatim with the original as the late Act of Parliament requires for the conviction of counterfeiters of those coines. And upon comparing the said Representation with the said late Order of Council & printed Proclamation, I humbly represent that the weight of the single Pistole & Lewis d'or being in the said Proclamation put 4dwt 8gr the weight of the double Pistole & Lewis d'or ought in proportion to be put in a new Proclamation 8dwt 16gr & that of the quadruple Pistole 17dwt 8gr. And the Moyder of Portugal (which as the Merchants bring them hither a little worn weigh one with another 6dwt 2134gr; & before wearing may be a quarter of a grain or half a grain heavier) may be put in weight 6dwt 22gr in the same Proclamation & valued at 30s. For in Ireland where an English shilling passes for thirteen pence the Moyder of this weight is worth 29s 1112, recconing gold 22 carats fine at 3l 19s 834d per ounce, which is the standard value, or 30s 0034d, recconing gold 22 carrats fine at 4li per ounce as is ordinarily done. And 30s is a medium & the nearest round number. And a grain being allowed for wearing, this piece will be current till it weighs but 6dwt 21gr as was stated in the late Order of Council. And after that it will continue to be current by allowing 2d per grain for what it wants of the weight of 6dwt 22gr.  For the latter part of the printed Proclamation concerning the allowance for light pieces & concerning the scales & weights for weighing them, I am humbly of opinion should be continued in the next Proclamation. 
 <234v>  I humbly beg leave to represent further to your Lordship that the weights & values of the silver coins in the printed Proclamation would answer better to one another & to the coins themselves if two pence were taken from the value of the Crusado & twenty grains added to their weight of the Dollars. For the Crustado is recconed in Portugal too be the tenth part of the Moyder in value & the Moyder is worth 30s in Ireland as above & yet the Crusado is valued in the Proclamation at 3s 2d. Its weight before wearing is 11dwt 4gr. In the Proclamation its weight it put 10dwt 20gr, & a Crusado of this weight is  worth but 3s in Ireland. Rix Dollars Cross Dollars & other Dollars are in the Proclamation put of the same weight & value with pieces of eight of Mexico & Sevil,  Pillar pieces & Lewises. And yet The Dollars are much coarser & heavier then the pieces of eight & Lewises & ought to be 20 grains heavier to be of the same value. Rix Dollars before wearing weighed about 18dwt & 6, 8 or 10 grains & Cross Dollars 18dwt 1gr. Their weight in the Proclamation is 17dwt. That they may be worth 4s 9d (which is their value in the Proclamation) they should weigh 17dwt 20gr.  I am humbly of opinion therefore that the gold coins should be of the weight & fineness expressed in the paper annexed & the silver ones as in the pointed Proclamation unless  for the reasons above mentioned it should be thought fit to alter take 2d from the value of the Crusados & adds 18 gr to the weight of the Dollars All which &c these"

In obedience to your Lordships Order of reference of August 5th and 10th wherein Wee are directed to consider the qualification of Coll Parsons, Mr Croker Mr Ross and Mr Fowler to succeed Mr Harris in the place of Graver of the Mint, Wee humbly lay before your Lordship that the Master of the Mint considering what inconveniency the Mint lately suffered and may againe suffer by taking in Cutters of seales into the chief Graver's place, did upon his succeeding Mr. Neale put a Clause into the Indenture then made between the Crown and himself, whereby the Gravers sallary of 325L per Annum upon the next voydance of the place should cease in order to a new establishment, For the Roetiers brought up no new Gravers under them, and Mr Harris who succeeded them being a Cutter of Seales and not skilled in that sort of Graving which is proper for the money, Imployed Mr. Croker to do all that work for an allowance of 175li per Annum and retained to himselfe the Remaining 150li per Annum and Mr. Croker was not bred up in the service of the Mint, but now by long practice he workes very well, and wee are humbly of Opinion that he is the fittest person to be made first Graver of the Mint. It is humbly proposed therefore for the advantage and security of the Coyn against Counterfeiting that there should be a sett of Gravers Constantly brought up in the Mint who haveing once attained to perfection may keep their Art amongst themselves and propagate it to Probationers or Apprentices & be succeeded by them For which end Wee humbly propose that Mr. Croker be now made the first Graver of the Mint with a salary of 200li per Annum for maintaining himselfe and a servant to fire and polish the Dyes and turn the press, and be allowed that part of the Gravers house in which he now lives and that Mr Samuell Bull who is now a Probationer and has a salary of 60li per Annum be made second Graver of the Mint with a salary of 80l per Annum if your Lordship shall approve thereof, and be

    allowed the other part of the Graver House, and that  two Roomes  over the great Press Room and over Mr Crokers shop be reserved for a third Graver or Apprentice to lodge & work in  Collonel Parsons & Mr Fowler doe not grave thimselves, but imploy others & for that reason are less fit for  the service of the Mint. Mr le Clerc is a quick & skilfull Fraver, but we humbly desire more time to consider of filling the third Gravers place. Besides the place of Graver of  to the Mint Mr Harris   was also Graver of seales to her Majesty  which is no part of the constitution of the Mint & Mr Ross desires to succeed Mr Harris only in this place & by a seale which he has graved for the Dutchy of Lancaster he seems qualified for  it. I humbly beg leave to lay before your Lordship that the Gravers for their encouragement & for restraining the liberty of  making Medals with the  Effigies of the King or Queen have by a clause in their Patent been allowed & all other prohibited to make & sell such Medals:
    
         And this Office of Medal-maker to the Crown has been sometimes encouraged by a large salary out of the Civil list, & sometimes granted to strangers & is as part of the Constitution of the Mint. For by the ancient constitution of the Mint the Master & Worker imploys not the Graver but the Moneyers to coyne whatever the government has occasion for whether money medals or healing pieces, the weight allay & form of the  money & medals being first appointed by 
        
         <153r> 
    
    King of Queen by device of the Council & the Graver only making the stamps.
    
    
        
        Now if for saving her Majesty & the Council the trouble of  giving  Orders about such Medals as the government has no occasion for & for encouraging the Graver to improve themselves & to  be content with less salaries it be thought fit to continue this Office or Privileg{e} to the Gravers: we are humbly of opinion that the Graver  be obliged to set his name or the first letters thereof upon  his own Medals  to distinguish them from Medals made by the Queens Mint & that he may be restrained from dispersing  them before a specimen of them has been shewed to your Lordship or  be otherwise limited as her Majesty shall think fit.  And if it should be thought fit  upon  any emergent occasion to restrain him, I am  ready to coyn such Medals as her Majesty  shall  Order,  as in the case of Coronation Medals & to deliver any number of them to your Lordships Order.

        Decembr we have perused the annexed Memorial of the Master of her Majestys 
        Mint at Edinburgh, & for explaining our opinion about the Order which maken be  convenient to be made upon it we humbly represent that Gold & Silver is imported into her Majestys Mint in the Tower in the Ingott & if it be not in the Ingot the Merchant or Importer  causes it to be made into ingots at his own charge & loss by wast before the Master & Worker can receive it by weight & assay upon his Note in order to coyn it. And according to this method the publick paid for this first melting & wast in the late recoinage of the hammered moneys in England, & the silver should be now placed among the losses which private persons may sustein by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coyn of England & which by the act of union are to made good out of the Equivalent in the first place But the disposal of the Equivalent being lodged in Commissioners by Act of Parliament & her Majesties Privy Counsel of Scotland having ordered this melting with an allowance of three pence half penny per pound weight for the performance thereof, & having by Act of Parliament a power over the Coynage Duty of the Mint at Edinburgh but not over the Equivalent: the consideration of this matter seems to us to lye  before her Majestys said Privy Councill & before the Commissioners of the Equivalent.  For the Act of Parliament which appoints the Duty for coynage in Scotland ordeins that the said Duty shall be kept apart in a chest & not be delivered but at such times as her Majesty or her Privy Council shall think fit to the General & Master of her Majestys Mint for payment of the salaries of the Officers thereof & for defraying the  expence & charge of a free coynage & for the farther encouragement of Merchants & others to import Bullion. And we do not know but that by the last words of this clause of this Act a power may be lodged in her Majesty or her Council of applying the said moneys even to the first melting whenever it shall be thought fit for the encouragement of coynage. We are therefore humbly of opinion that before your Lordship give any Order about this matter, application be made by the General & Master of the said Mint or one of them to her Majesties most Honourable Privy Council in Scotland & to the Commissioners of the Equivalent  for an Order for the payment of the said three pence half penny out of the propper fund. The charge of refining the coarser Ingots to bring the remainder to standard  is certainly to be allowed to the Master in his accounts among the incident charges. In recoining the forreign moneys it may amount to about 3d  per pound weight. In recoining those of Scotland to less then a farthing per pound weight & we are humbly of opinion that moneys should be advanced  from time to time by the Commissioners of the Treasury of Scotland out of the said Chest to the Master for enabling 
        
         <159r> 
{him to} bear this charge, which mayy be one ‡
         < insertion from f 158v >   either by orders of the Commissioners of the Treasury   at such times as her Majestys Privy Council in Scotland shall think fit or by your Lordships Order by virtue of a signe manual  the Order being directed to            Steward Collectors of the Bullion for coynage. For the Act of Parliament which appoints the Duty for coynage in Scotland ordeins that the said Dity shall – – – – import Bullion. And the Officer who keeps the key of this Chest is called the collector of the Bullion < text from f 159r resumes >  by Order either of her Majesty of {of} her Privy Council in Scotland. The Moneyers are allowed ten pence halfpenny for marking & coyning the moneys in her Majesties Mint in the Tower & could not be prevailed with to send some of their body from their families & from their farms to the Mint at Edinborough upon lower terms then those allowed in her Majestys  Warrant, whereof the 9d per pound weight is the same allowance for coynage as in the Tower, but the Master & Worker of her Majestys Mint in the Tower pays only 8d thereof out of this standing allowance for coynage & her Majesty gives the other penny to the Moneyers for coyning the moneys well. And we are humbly of opinion that her Majesty may make the like gift to the Moneyers in Scotland for their good service, whether it be of a penny per pound weight, or of the charges mentioned in the said Warrant above the nine pence (what, in our opinion may amount to almost a  penny per pound weight) directing the Masrter by a signe Manual to make this allowance to the Moneyers out of such moneys as shall be imprest to him for the service of the Mint & the Auditors to allow the same in his Account. When it is determined what  be allowed incidents are to be allowed out of the coynage money to the Master, we  are humbly of opinion that the Master do lay   before the Commissioners of her  Majestys Treasury in Scotland monthly or as often as shall be convenient an Account (signed by the other Officers if it be required) of what moneys have been coyned since the last accounts & what moneys are due to him for the same or for any preceding coynage  including incidents,  ☉
 < insertion from f 158v > ☉ or what money he is directed by her Majesty or your Lordship to pay upon any account of the coynage, that the said Commissioners of the   may order such summs too be paid to him upon account from time to time as may enable him to carry on the coynage. < text from f 159r resumes > 
 And whenever it shall be thought convenient to bring the constitution of that Mint nearer to the constitution of the Mint in the Tower we are humbly of opinion that by her Majestys signe manual,  such round summs of coynage money as your Lordship shall think  fit (suppose of one two, four or five thousand pounds at a time) be paid from time to time by the Cash-keeper  to the General & Master upon Account to be kept in a chest in the Treasury of the Mint under the keys of the General the Master the Warden & the Counter warden or three of them & issued out thence by the common consent of the said Officers at due times & in due summs for paying the salaries & charges of coynage &  other just charges of the Mint by the said Master, he giving security & accounting annually for the same. All which For the words of the Act are these. It is agreed that in {the f}irst place out of the aforesaid summ (that is out of the summ {call}ed the Equivalent) what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any losses which private persons may sustain by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coin of England, may be made good. Considering therefore that her Majestys most honourable Privy Council of Scotland have direction  the Receivers of the old moneys to  deliver the same to Mr Allardes to be melted into Ingots  & have ordered that Mr Allards should have 312 per pound weight for this melting   & wast: we are humbly of opinion that 
        †  † the said Receivers should out of the new coyned moneys pay  this {9}12 in the first  place &  set down the same in the account of the losses susteined by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coin of England, & that if any doubt arise about this matter, application should be made to her Majestys Privy Council of Scotland  before your Lordship give any Order about it. † the payment of this 312 should be made (before all other payments) by the said Receivers out of the new coynd moneys  & be placed in the account of the losses susteined by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coin of England, & that if any doubt  application be made to her Majestys Privy Council in Scotland   for ordering this payment before your Lordship give any order about it. it seems to us that the said 312 is  due to Mr Allards from the said Receivers by the said Act of Parliament & Order of Council together  & upon demand ought to be paid out of the new coyned money in the first place before this  money  be applyed to make good any other losse or dammages or deficiency  {whatsoever}: And that the said Receivers   are to place this payment in their Account of the losses susteined by reducing the coin of Scotland to the standard & value of the coin of England. And  where  any doubt arises about this matter, it  seems to lye before  her Majestys most honourable Privy Council  of Scotland, who  may heare the same  upon application made to them, before your Lordship give any Order about it, they having appointed this melting.    And after the silver is thus delivered to the Master & in his custody he bears all the charge of melting & coining it, but the charge  & loss susteined by melting it into Ingots  before this delivery is always born by Importers   because the Silver is then in his  custody & at his disposal 
         & he must make it fit to be  assayed &  weighed before the Master can receive for coynage according to the intrinsic value. Accordingly  in the late recoinage of the hammered moneys in England the publick paid for  melting  the money into ingots"

        Tunns of Tin consigned to him & company at Amsterdam to 
        be disposed of after the best rates not under 4412 Gilders per hundred 
        merchant weight of Holland (that is not under 4l. 2s. 412  per  Averdupois or 4. 2. 5d) for a commission of two per cent 
            clear of all charges & advanced 22500l upon it at 4 per cent as soon as it arrived at Amsterdam. The charges at home were 1242li. 18s. 10d including 1200li for customes. 2The like quantity was consigned to him Iune 8th 1705 
        on the same terms. The charges at home 1266li. 19s. 2d. The first parcel was sold in about 14 or 15 months the second in about ten months 3The first parcel produced by sale 31467li 14s sterling, the second 31656li 4s clear of all charges except interest for money advanced upon  this tin  which came to about 1300li. This interest being deducted from the produce of both parcells the remainder is 61823li 18s, which is after the rate of 3. 17. 4d per   averdupois. And the Queen bear the charges at home & ran the hazzard of insolvent Chapmen 5A new proposal of Mr Drummond for a third parcel of 400 Tuns being referred to the Officers of the Mint, they reported that the Queen would lose 5s per   by the bargain & my Lord Treasurer agreed to the report & directed the Officers of the Mint to signify to all Merchan{ts} that he would send no more Tin abroad by commission. 4Mr Stratford & Mr Free Feb 20th 175 had 240 Tunns of 
        Tin consigned to them for Hamborough upon the same terms as the former was to Mr Drummond. The charges at home 765li 10s 8d. Sixteen blocks were 
        lost by an insolvent Chapman, & the rest produced 19332. 2. 5. clear of 
        all charges  except interest for money advanced which amounted to about 490li. This interest being deducted the remainder is 18842li sterling which is after the rate of 3li 18s 5d per  averdupois. And the Queen bear the charges at home. If Mr Stratford & partners  notwithstanding the advantage they have in their hands at any time give for the Tin at Hamburgh will give after the rate of 4li per   & 
        for every hundred Tunns pay 8000li within one month after the consignement 
        of the same for sale at Hamborough,  
        taking 100 Tunns here for making up his security: the Queen will not only save the duty of 3s per  but also  receive more money by the sale of  this Tin then in the instances above mentioned, &  the markets at Hamborough & parts adjacent will be better supplied with Tin till Christmas 1702 then otherwise & money will come in faster  for paying off the debts in course upon the Tin, & the great quantity of  her Majestys Tin at Hambourg{h}  whereby the Merchants are freighted from that Market will be lessened & by degrees removed to London. And as for the objections of a monopoly & selling at extravagant rates: this   will be no more a monopoly then the Commissions above mentioned were  which were not called monopolies by the Merchants themselves. It will  be a preference & enable Mr Stratford &  Partners to undersell other Merchants by about 6d or 12d  per   but not hinder other merchants from trading there as  much as they shall find it for their advantage, & therefore ought not to be called a monopoly. And if  Mr Stratford should sell at extravagant rates, the price would soon invite other merchants to the market. Mr Stratford reccons that he can sell 200 Tuns
        
         <558v> 
        
        per annum.  And I do not see how this Tin will be disposed of at any time hereafter with more  advantage & less liability to exception  And  the money  coming in before the sale  I reccon an advantage of about 1s per  above that  of   receiving it out of the Queens warehouse at Hamburgh for Tin sold to the Merchants. 6 The present Commissions of Mr  Beringer & Mr Stratford & partners are to sell when the time comes without selling them the lowest price, are more unlimited & by consequence less safe for her Majesty then the former; besides that teh selling to pay themselves would interrupt the due course of payments. 7 The Proposal of Mr Stratford is more advantageous to her Majesty then any of these Commissions & deserves less to be called a monopoly. It would enable him to undersell other Merchants by about 6d or 12 d per , & thereby discourage them (but not disable them) from carrying Tin to that market,   and  a high price (which is the crime of a monopoly) would invite them thither Mr Stratford reccons that he can sell 200 Tuns per annum: which would bring Hamburgh together carry off above 500 Tunns per annum.  I herewith send your Lordship a coppy of the Report of the 
        Officers of the Mint upon a Petition from  Cornwall for a 
        new Contract for Tin at such a price as her Majesty might 
        not lose by,  &  for taking off a greater quantity of Tinn then before.  A few months before the date of this Report I  
        computed the price at 3li 8s 6d supposing no more Tin to be received 
        then the consumption would carry off,  for preventing of 
        I added the last clause of this report. I send your Lordship also a further Report upon the  present state of the Tin, & remain  My Lord  Your Lordships most humble & most obedient 3 The two parcels produced by the sale 63014li clear of interest & all other charges except  the duty of 3s per . And this produced is after the rate of 3li. 18s. 9d14 per . He sold the 1st parcel in about 14 or 15 Months & the second in 10 a ve{illeg} being in{illeg} over the Rhine into France  Mr Stratford & Mr Free Feb 20 1705 had 240 Tunns of Tin 
        consigned to Hamborough upon like terms & upon notice of its arrival at Hamborough advanced 12000li upon it at 
        4 per cent. Sixteen blocks were lost by an unsolvent chapman 
        & the rest produced 19286li. 11. 9  clear of interest & all other charges 
         {e}xcept the duty of 3s per Cent. And this produce  is after the rate of 4li. 0s. 4d per  . The present Commissions to sell when the time comes, without setting the lowest price are not so good as the former, not to mention the interruption of the course of  payments & the damping of the markets by the great quantities of Tin lying abroad till it be sold. If Mr Stratford & partners will give after the rate of 4li per 
         &  within one month after the consignement of every 100 Tunns for sale advance 
        the full price of 8000li, the bargain considering that the Queen runs no risque of selling upon Trust would be as good as any of the former commissioners besides the duty of 3s per  saved to her Majesty. Mr Stratford expects to sell 200 Tuns per annum, & then  this bargain would be a quarter per cent better then to receive  ready money  upon consignement of 50 Tuns  for sale quarterly, & Merchant seldome take above 50 Tuns at a time And as for the objection of a monopoly, it lies as much against all the Commissions above mentioned. Other merchants are not disabled from sending Tin to that market.  And selling at too high a price (which is the fault of a monopoly) would invite them thither. Mr  Stratford would be  enabled to undersell other Merchants by about  10d in the wt (which promotes the sale), but not to raise the price of the market. For a merchant may have Tin here for 3li 19s per wt including the duty, & will scarce reccon the  shipping it off & carrying it to Hamborough at above 1s.

I If there by no increase or decrease of weight the  Ingot is reported 24 carats fine,  it being of the same fineness with the piece refined by the Assay. And this is fine gold in the sense of the law of England & of all nations who practise this way of Assaying. But if there be a decrease of weight, the decrease is observed & the Ingot is reported so much coarser then fine gold as the decrease of weight amounts unto. The Refiner makes fine gold by refining it after the same manner  is a great quantity as the Assayer refines it in a small quantity. The gold must be mixed with silver in the same proportion in both cases &  Tested with the same   proportion of Lead & in the same degree of heat in both cases & laminated to the same thinness in both cases & watered twice & but twice with waters of the same strength in the same proportion & heat & length of operation that the waters may work alike in both cases, & bring the gold to the same degree of finenes in both cases,  without roasting it But it the  operations be not alike the gold may become finer or less fine by the Refiners art then by the Assayers, that is finer or less fine then 24 carats.  Refiners seldome  re at the pains & charges of making gold so fine as it is made by the Assay, & therefore the Iury who makes the standard Trial assays the Refiners fine gold & if it be not 24 carats fine they roast it to bring it to a due degree of fineness. And when the trial piece is made they assay it several times to see if it be standard.  It's possible for a Refiner to make gold finer then by the Assay.  & a Chymist by Antimony  may make it still finer And therefore the Iury should take care that the fine gold be not too fine. And that it be neither too fine nor too course they should assay it several times.   In the stature of 12 Hen 6. C. 12, the  Kings Assayer is called a person indifferent between the Master of the Mint & the Merchant, & it is there ordeined that he  be present when Bullion of silver is brought into the Mint that he may rightfully set the value upon the same according to law in case of variance between the Master & the merchant. And therefore I humbly pray that her Majesty may be put in mind of  ordeining an Assaymaster before her departure to Windsor, And since Mr  Charles Brattel is approved by both parties  as a fit Arbitrator, between them & hath carried on the business of the Mint  eavenly for some months without any  variance arising between them, & hath been  freely entrusted from time to time by the Merchants with great quantities of Bullion without any miscarriage,  or complaint,  & if any variance or miscariage should happen  it would tend to the discouragement of the coinage  I humbly recommend  the said Mr C. Brattel as a person well qualified for the said Office, in point of skill, diligence, credit, &  probity. Brief Observations concerning the Triall of the monies in the Pix  1.

        out of hammered moneys which came slowly from the country after 
        the heat of the recoynage was at an end. That coyned in the year

        in by the Peace & by the remains of the Spanish Trade. 
        
        And most of that  coyned 
        in 1704. And that  coyned in the ten following years has  been from English lead & sometimes from wrought plate imported upon premiums 
        granted by Act of Parliament. The Gold coyned in 1701 & part of 1702 was out of Lewidors which by 
        our valuing them at 17. 6 a piece came into England in great plenty 
        in the preceding years untill by King William's Proclamation they were 
        lowered to 17s a piece, & thereupon were brought to the Mint. That 
        coyned in the ten following years came from Portugal & some 
        of it from Iamaica. And a great part of that which has been coyned in the 
        two  years  ending at Christmas last, came from French monies   imported in specie & melted down in Ingots by the Goldsmiths. NB. These years are from Christmas to Christmass.  The silver coyned in the years 1696, 1697 1698  1699  1700 was out of the old English hammered moneys  & wrought Plate.  The gold coyned in 1701 & part of 1702 was out of Lewidors which by our valuing them at 17s 6d a piece came into England in great plenty untill by the Kings Proclamation they were  lowered to 17 a piece & then they came to the Mint. The Peace brought in a competent quantity of forreign silver moneys in the years 1700 & 1701.  In the year 1697 the coynage of gold was put off  till the silver hammer{ed} moneys should b e recoyneed, & thereby the coynage of gold became the greater in the year 16 † The ☽ coyned in the years 1696 1697 & 1698 was out out of the English hammered moneys & wrought plate. That coyned in the years 1699, 1700,  was chiefly out of hammered moneys which came slowly out of the county after the heat of the recoinage was at an end. That coyned in the year 1701 was chiefly out of forreign moneys & bullion brought in by the peace. And the Gold coyned in 1701 & part of 1702 was out of Lewidors which by our valuing them at 17s 6d a piece came into England in great plenty in the preceding years untill by the Kings Proclamation they were lowered to 17s a piece, upon which they came to the Mint."

May it please your Lordships  The Act of Coinage being near expiring, We have thought it our Duty humbly to lay before your Lordships the annexed Abstract shewing what the Moneys leviable by that Act have amounted unto these  three years  last past, & what the charges of the Mints in the Tower & at Edinburgh have amounted unto during the same time.  By this Abstract the Income has been about 9600li yearly at a medium & the Expence about 14380 yearly And this expence is to the Income as about 3 to 2. The coynage has  increased every year since the peace & if it continues to be so great as it has been the two last years the charge of the Mint will exceed the income by about five or six thousand pounds yearly. This charge has been supplied hitherto out of the stock which accrued to the Mint in the time of  war when the coynage was small, & by the great coinage  since the  peace this stock is now reduced to less then one thousand pounds, which will scarce suffice to carry on the coinage above a month longer.

And the Moyder (which as the merchant bring them hither a little worn weigh one with another 6dwt 2134gr, & beput in weight 6dwt 22grains in the same Proclamation. For those of this weight  are in Ireland worth 29s. 1112d recconing an  english shilling there at  13d &  gold 22 carrats fine at  3li 19s 8d34 per ounce,  which is the standard value. But if gold 22 carrats fine be recconed at 4li per ounce as is commonly done, a Moyder weighing 6dwt 22gr will be wroth 30s 0d34. And therefore taking the nearest round number it may be valued at 30s without any error worth noting the weight being 6dwt 22gr. And at this rate all Moyders weighing above 6dwt 21gr will be current without allowing any thing for wearing But if the weight & value of the coins in the said printed Proclamation are to be reconsidered, then  the following observations may be made 
        
        upon them.  The  Pistole & Lewis d'or as they are commonly current weigh  one with another 4dwt 7gr being lightned about a grain by wearing, & those of this weight are worth 18s 6d in Ireland  where an English shilling  goes for 13d.  The Ducatoon of Flanders before wearing weighs (one piece with another) 20dwt 22gr. That it may be worth 6s in Ireland,  as its valued, in the Proclamation, its weight ought to be 21dwt. In the printed Proclamation its weight is put 20dwt 16gr without allowing any thing for the eight grains wanting,  & nothing is allowed for wearing till it want 12grains more in weight. The pieces of eight of Mexico & Sevil & the Pillar pieces & French Lewises before wearing weigh one with another 17dwt 12gr. That they may be worth 4s 9d in Ireland they ought to weight 17dwt 8gr. In the printed Proclamation their weight is put 17dwt without allowing any thing for the 8gr wanting in weight. The Cross Dollar before wearing weights (at a medium) 18dwt 1gr.  That it may be worth 4s 9d it ought to weigh 18dwt. In the printed Proclamation its weight is put 17dwt  wihtout allowing any thing for the penny weight wanting which amounts to 3d. Rix Dollars are of several sorts & before wearing weigh about 18dwt & 8 or 10gr. That they may be worth 4s 9d in Ireland they ought to weigh 17dwt & 18 or 20gr. In the printed Proclamation their weight is put 17dwt without allowing any thing for the want of 18 or 20gr in weight. The old Peru piece of eight  that it may be worth 4 6d in Ireland should weight 17dwt & is put at that weight in the printed Proclamation. The Crusado of Portugal before wearing weights 11dwt 4gr. That it may be worth 3s 2d it ought to weigh 11dwt 10gr. In the printed Proclamation its weight is put 10dwt 20gr without allowing any thing for the  want of 14gr in weight. In the end of the printed Proclamation the weights used in Ireland by vertue of a Proclamation dated 21 Feb 1697 are established to continue in use for weighing the coins therein mentioned. If  those weights  were in ounces penny weights & grains they may serve for all the coins: if in single pieces for single coins,  (for I remember the send of such

        weights from hence)  those that are wanting made by  speedily made here (if it be thought fit) & sent with the new Order of Council  or as soon after as may be, that they may be ratified by the new Proclamation. The allowance of  2d per grain for the wearing of gold coins & three half pence per halfpenny weight for the wearing of silver coins is as neare to the truth as can be put in round numbers.  May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships order of Reference signified to me by Mr Taylors letter of Iune 16th Instant, I have perused  the Representation from the Lords of the Privy (in Ireland touching  a late order of Council  for giving currency  in that kingdom by Proclamation to some forreign coins which were omitted in a former Proclamation a printed copy of which they ahve sent desiring a clause to be added to the said Order for making allowance for light pieces as was done in the said Proclamation   & that the Order may be compre{h}end also  the forreign coins mentioned in that Proclamation, because the original of that Proclamation  under the broad seal was  destroyed in the late fire  which happened there at the Council chamber: so that the Clerk of the Council cannot now certify that the printed copy agrees verbatim with the original as the  late Act of Parliament requires for the conviction of   the Counterfeiters of those coins. Concerning all which I humbly represent that the coins mentioned in the said Proclamation & Order ought to be of the  weight mentioned in the following Table that they may be  in Ireland of the value  mentioned therein, supposing gold & silver to be raised a penny in the shilling in Ireland above what it is in England. And the quadruple double halfs & quarters in proportion. Concerning all which I  humbly observe, make the following observations  In the printed Proclamation the weight of the Pistole & Lewidor was put 4dwt 8gr after which rate the quadruple Pistole  should weigh  17dwt 8g that is  416gr & the double  Pistole should weigh 8dwt 16gr that is 208gr But in the Memorial upon which the late Order of Council was grounded
        
         <240r> 
{the}  quadruple Pistole was put only 408gr & the double Pistole & Lewidor 204gr.  I am  humbly of opinion that in the new Proclamation the quadruple & double Pistoles should be put in proportion to the single ones.  The double Lewidor & Pistole new out of the Mint weight 8dwt 16gr & the single one 4dwt 8gr, but as they come out hither  a little worn the Pistoles & Lewidors are a grain lighter one with another & this weight answers to  their value in Ireland where a shilling goes for thirteen pence & all other money should be valued in proportion. I humbly propose therefore that  in the new Proclamation the French & Spanish gold moneys be put as follows The piece commonly called the quadruple Spanish Pistole of Gold weighing  seventeen penny weight four grains  to pass at three pounds & fourteen shillings. The piece commonly called the double Spanish or French Pistole of Gold or double Lewidor weighing eight penny weight & fourteen grains to pass at one pound & seventeen shillings. The piece commonly called the Spanish or French Pistole of gold weighing four penny weight & seven grains to pass at eighteen shillings & six pence The piece commonly called the Spanish or French half Pistole weighing two penny weight & three grains & an half to pass at nine shillings & three pence. The piece commonly called the Spanish or French quarter Pistole weighing one penny weight one grain & three quarters to pass at 4 shillings & 712 pence. But if the weight of the single Pistole & half Pistole be put as in the late Proclamation, then  the weight of the quadruple Pistole  should in proportion be put 17dwt 8gr & that of the double one 8dwt 16gr. The Moyders of Portugal as they are brought over by the Merchant weighs one with another  6dwt 2134gr &  in Ireland at that weight recconing standard gold at 2d a grain in England But is the standard Gold be recconed at 3li 19s 812 per ounce, (which is the standard value a Moyder of that weight will be worth 29 1034, are worth 30s 0d & fresh out of the Mint they may weight 6d 22gr or 6dwt 2214 one with another & so be worth about 30s.  If for avoiding fractions their weight be put 6dwt 22gr & their value 30s, all those pieces that  weigh above 6dwt 21gr will be current without allowing any thing for lightness. And then the Portugal money may  stand in the Proclamation as follows The Portugal  piece of Gold commonly called a Moyder weighing 6dwt 22gr to pass at thirty shillings  The piece commonly called the quarter Moyder weighing one penny weight seventeen grains & an half to pass at seven shillings & six pence. The Ducatoon of Flanders that it my be worth 6s in Ireland ought to weight 21dwt. Its usual weight before wearing (taking one piece with another) is 20d 22gr. Its weight in the Proclamation is put 20dwt. 16gr & nothing is allowed for the want of 8gr. The pieces of eight of Mexico & Sevil & the Pillar pieces of eight & French Lewisses  that they may be worth four shillings & nine pence in Ireland  ought to weight 17dwt 8gr They weigh one with another before wearing 17dwt 12gr. In the Proclamation their weight is put  only 17dwt {0}gr nothing is allowed for the want of 8gr. The Cross Dollar  that it may be worth 4s. 9d in Ireland ought to weigh 18dwt, & this is its usual weight before wearing. In the Proclamation its weight is put 17dwt. & nothing is allowed for the deficiency of a penny weight which amounts to 3d.  Rix Dollars  that they may be worth 4s 9d in Ireland  ought to weigh 17dwt & 18 or 20 grains. Their usual weight before wearing  {is} 18dwt 9gr. Their weight in the Proclamation 17dwt, & no allowance made for the want of 18 or 20 grains. The old Peru piece of eight that it may be worth 4s 6d in Ireland ought to weigh 17dwt. Its put at that weight in the Proclamation. The Crusado of Portugal that it may be worth 3s 2d ought to weigh 11 deadweight 12gr. Its usual weight before wearing is 11dwt 4gr Its weight in the Proclamation 10dwt 20gr, & no allowance for the want of 16gr. I am humbly of opinion that these peices should be valued only at 3s, this being the value of those that weigh 10dwt 20gr. If all the pieces of silver money were put at their just weight in proportion to the value at which they are to be current, it would help to preserve them from clipping; especially if that weight be nea{r} the original weight of the pieces. And the currency of good money will not be hindred thereby because there is an allowance of twel{ve} grains for wearing before the pieces can be refused in payment &  after that they are still current upon abating three half pence  in the value In the end of the printed Proclamation there is mention made of weights used in Ireland by vertue of a Proclamation dated 21 Feb 1697 for weighing the several sorts of coins  made current in that Kingdom. I remember the making of those weights by the standard weights in the Mint. And if any new weights shall be wanting they may be speedily made that  their use may be established by the Proclamation now to be issued  A Ducatoon weighs before wearing 20dwt 22gr & is worth in Ireland 5. 1134. In the printed Proclamation its weight is put 20dwt. 16gr & it valu  6s. To be of that value it should weight 21dw{t}. A piece of 8 & Lewis weighs before wearing 17dwt 12gr & is worth in Ireland 4s 10d12 In the Proclamation its weight it put 17dwt & its value 4 9. To be of that value it should weigh 17dwt 8gr. The Cross Dollar weighs before wearing 18dwt & in Ireland is worth 4s. 9. In the Proclamation its weight is put 17dwt & its value 4s. 9d. Either a penny weight should add to its weight or 3d deducted from its value. Rix Dollars are of various sorts & before wearing weight about 18dwt & 8  or 9 grains & are worth 4. 1012. In the Proclamation  their weight is 17dwt & their value 4. 9. To be worth 4. 9 their weight should be about 17dwt 18gr. The old Peru piece weighing 17dwt is worth 4s 6d as in the Proclamation. The Crusado of Portugal weighs before wearing 11dwt 4gr & is worth 3s 114d. In the Proclamation its weight is put 10dwt 20gr it value 3s 2g. That it may be  of that value it ought to weigh  11dwt 10gr."

May it please your Lordship  1 In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference signified to me by Mr Taylor in his Letter of Iune 16th Instant, I have perused the Representation from the Lords of the Privy Council in Ireland touching a late Order of Council here for giving currency in that Kingdom by Proclamation to some forreign coines which were omitted in a former Proclamation, a printed copy of which they have sent, desiring a clause to be added to the said Order for making such allowance for light pieces as was made in the said Proclamation, & that the Order may comprehend also the forreign coins mentioned in that printed Proclamation because the Original thereof under the broad seal was destroyed in the late fire which happened there at the Council chamber, so that the Clerk of the Council cannot now certify that the printed copy agrees verbatim with the original as the late Act of Parliament requires for the conviction of Counterfeiters of those coyns. And upon comparing the said Presentation with the said late Order of Council & printed Proclamation I humbly represent that   the weight of the single Pistole & Lewis d'or being in the said Proclamation put 4dwt 8gr  the weight of the double Pistole & Lewis d'or ought in proportion to be put in a new Proclamation 8dwt 16gr & that of a quadruple Pistole 17dwt 8gr. And the Moyder (which as the Merchants bring them hither  a little worn, weigh one with another 6dwt 2134gr & before wearing may be a quarter of a grain or half a grain heavier) may be put in weight 6dwt 22gr in the same Proclamation For  in Irland where  an English shilling passes for 13d the Moyders of this weight are worth 29s. 1112d, recconing  gold 22 carats fine at 3li 19s 8d34 per ounce which is the standard value;  Or   30s 0034  recconing  gold 22 carats fine  at 4li per ounce, as is commonly done,  And at a medium in the nearest round numbers  it may be valued at 30s without any error worth noting, & it will be current without any abatement for wearing if it weighs above 6dwt 21gr notwithstanding that its  weight be put 6dwt 22gr in the Proclamation. But if the weight & value of the forreign coins in the said printed Proclamation are to be reconsidered, the following observations may be made upon them. The Pistole & Lewis d'or as they are commonly current weight one with another 4dwt 7gr, being lightned about a grain by wearing & those of this weight are worth 18s 6d in Ireland where an English shilling does for 13d. The Ducatoon of Flanders before wearing weighs (one piece with another)
         <237v> 20dwt 22gr. That it may be worth 6s in Ireland as it's val{ued} in the printed Proclamation, its weight should be 21dwt. In the printed Proclamation its weight  is put 20dwt 16gr without allowing any thing for the  eight grains more in weight is allowed for wearing till it want 12 grains more in weight. The pieces of eight of Mexico & Sevil & the Pillar piece of eight & French Lewis before wearing weigh one with another 17dwt 12gr. That they may be worth 4s 9d in Ireland as they are valued in the Proclamation they ought to weigh 17dwt 8gr. In the printed Proclamation their weight is put 17dwt without allowing any thing for 8gr wanting in the weight. The Cross Dollar before wearing weighs (at a medium) 18dwt 1gr. That it may be worth 4s 9d as its valued in the Proclamation it  ought to weigh 18dwt. In the Proclamation its weight is put 17dwt without allowing any thing for the penny weight wanting, which amounts to 3d. Rix Dollars are of several sorts & before wearing weigh about 18dwt & 8 or 10 grains. That they may be worth 4s 9d in Ireland they ought to weigh 17dwt & 18 or 20 grains. In the printed Proclamation their weight it put 17dwt without allowing any thing for the want of  18 or 20gr in weight. The old Peru piece of eight, that it may be worth 4s. 6d in Ireland should weigh 17dwt & is put at that weight in the printed Proclamation. The Crusado of Portugal  before wearing weighs 11dwt 4gr. That it may be wroth 3s 2d it ought to weigh 11dwt 10gr. In the printed Proclamation its weight is put 10dwt without allowing any thing for the want of 14s in weight. The allowance of 2d per grain for the weighing of gold coins & three half pence per half penny weight for the wearing of silver coins is as neare the truth as ca{n} be put in round numbers & is sufficient for single pieces, & I am humbly of opinion that it should be inserted into the  2. The latter part of the printed Proclamation concerning the allowan{ce} for light pieces & the seales & weights for weighing them I am humbly of opinion should be continued in the next Proclamation. I humbly beg leave to represent further to your Lordship  concerning the silver coins made current by the said printed Proclamation that  that the silver pieces  mentioned in the said Proclamation are put lighter b{e} then in proportion to their just value by eight grains or above. The Ducatoon of Flanders before wearing weighs one piece with another 20dwt 22gr. In the Proclamation
        
     <238r> 
        
        they are valued at  6s. To be of that value they should weigh 21dwt. Their weight in the printed Proclamation is put 20dwt 16gr which is eight grains less & no abatement in value is made for the want of these 8gr. When by wearing they want 12gr more, in all 20gr of their just weight allowance is made  of three half pence only for the want of the last 12 grains. Their weight in the Proclamation should have been 200dwt 22gr.  And then they would have been current till they had wanted 12 grains of their weight  by wearing. And by allowing three half pence for this defect of weight they would have been still current. The pieces of 8 of Mexico  & sevil & Pillar pieces of eight  I humbly beg leave further to represent to your Lordship that  Dollars are coarser then Pieces of Eight I humbly beg leave further to represent to your Lordship that  Cross Dollars Rix Dollars & other Dollars are  weightier & coarser then Pieces of eight & ought to weight 17dwt 20 grains that they may be worth 4s 9d ought to weight 17dwt 20gr & before wearing weigh one with another above 18dwt. as they are put in the Proclamation. And the Crusado of Portugal  weighing 10dwt. 20gr is worth but 3s in Ireland, whereas it is put in the Proclamation worth 3s 20gr. And the Ducatoon weighing twenty penny weight sixteen grains is worth only 5s 11d but in the next round number is valued at 6s in the Proclamation. If it should be thought fit to allow for the weight {&} courseness of the Dollars I humbly beg leave further to represent to your Lordship that Rix Dollars Cross Dollars & other Dollars which with pieces of 8 are valued in the printed Proclamation at 4 {9} are coarser  then pieces of eight &  should weigh  17dwt 20gr to be worth 4s 9d  as they are whereas in the printed Proclamation their weight is put only 17dwt. Rix Dollars before wearing weight about 18dwt 9grains & Cross Dollars 18dwt 1gr, & so might have been put at 17dwt 20gr in the Proclamation. The Crusados of Portugal   new out of the Mint weigh one with another 11d 4gr.  In the proclamation their weight is put 10dwt 18gr,  At this weight they are worth in Ireland 3s 0d whereas in the Proclamation they are valued at  3s 2d, which is 2d too much. 3.  I humbly beg leave further to represent to your Lordship that  rix Dollars Cross Dollars & other Dollars are in the printed Proclamation put of equal weight & value with pieces of 8.  They should weight 17dwt & 18 or 20gr  that they may be worth 4s 9d, but in the proclamation  their weight is put only 17dwt. Rix Dollars before wearing weigh about 18dwt 9gr & Cross Dollars 18dwt 1gr & so might have been put at 17dwt 20gr in the said Proclamation there being 12 grains  under this weight allowed for wearing before they should begin to lose their currency, & after that upon abating three half pence in the value for the want of these twelve grains they would still be current. I have annexed a scheme of the gold coins suitable to the weight & va{lue}  above represented.  All the silver coyns are already set down wit{h} their weight & value in the printed  Proclamation unless it should be thought fit to alter the weight of the Dollars & value of the Crusados. All which &c  And a grain being allowed for wearing, it will be current till it weights but 6dwt 21gr as in the late Order of Council. And after that it will continue to be current by allowing 2d per grain for what it wants of the weight of 6dwt 22gr. For the latter part of the printed Proclamation concernin the allowance for light pieces & concerning the seales & weights for weighing them, I am humbly of opinion should be continued in the next Proclamation.  I have annexed a scheme of the gold coins suitable to this Report & humbly  represent further that   the weights & values of the silver coines in the printed Proclamation would answer better to one another. If two pence were taken from the value of the Crusado of Portugal & twenty grains added to the weight of the Rix Dollars Cross Dollars & other Dollars. For  Dollars which ion the Proclamation are put of the same weight & value with  pieces of eight,  are heavier  & of coarser allay, & ought to be 18 or 20 grains heavier  that they may be of the same value. All which &c For in Portugal the Moyder is recconed worth 10 Crusados & the Crusado before wearing weighs 11dwt 4gr.   &c  The silver coins are  all of them already set down in the Printed Proclamation. But the  Crusado of Portugal is there over valued. This piece before wearing weights 11dwt 4gr & in Portugal is recconed the tenth part of a Moyder. In the Proclamation eight grains are taken from the weight & two pence added to the value. It should be valued only at three shilling & the half at one shillings & sixpence. The Dollars  which are coarser & heavier then  the  pieces of eight & Lewises are put in the Proclamation of the same weight & value with them. To make them of the same value 20gr should be added to their weight. The Cross Dollar before wearing weighs 18dwt 1gr & the old Rix Dollars 18dwt & 8 or 10gr. To make them worth 4s 9d they should weigh 17dwt 20gr, where as in the Proclamation they are said to weigh only 17dwt  "

        growth of paper credit Mr P. (sec. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) justifies his assertions that there were Coyned in 
        silver Communibus Annis about 400000li per Annum from 1640 to 1660, 
        200000li per Annum and from 1660 to 1680 & less then 80000li per Annum from 
        1680 to 1695 These Assertions I disputed not, Except that I affirmed the 
        400000li per Annum to be not in silver alone but in gold & silver together. 
        But I represented that from this decrease of the silver Coynage nothing 
        could be argued against Paper Credit, & that for these two reasons. First because Mr. P considers not the whole Coynage of 
        both Gold & Silver together which makes our wealth but that of silver 
        alone For the Coynage of silver from 1640 to 1660 was much 
        greater then that of gold and now it is much less and this alteration of 
        the proportion arises not from Paper Credit but from the growing Exportation 
         of silver to the Indies while our gold stays at home, 
         our Merchants finding that silver is a better Commodity in the Indies then gold Secondly because the decrease of the Coynage from 1640 to 1695 
        was not uniform, as it should seem by Mr P.'s representation but had 
        severall periods of increasing and decreasing according to the vicissitudes 
        of Peace and war abroad all which ought to be distinguished and Considered 
        severally before any thing can be concluded from the Course of the 
        Coynage. For if the  coynage in the reign of King Cha. & King Iames II increased with paper credit when according to his 
            recconing it should have decreased, if at other times the decrease of the Coynage arose from 
        other Causes then Paper credit, then we must  ascribe  the increase to paper credit + the decrease not to Paper 
        credit but to those other causes, & so the argument from the Course of the 
        Coynage against Paper Credit will vanish.  Now the Course of the Coynage 
        answered to the vicissitudes of Peace and war abroad after this manner The Silver Coynage in the latter half of Queen Elizabeths reign 
        (after she had recoyned the base money of her Predecessors) & in the first five 
        years of King Iames was Communibus annis about 70 or 80 thousand pounds 
        per Annum. Then upon a Cessation of arms between the Dutch & Spaniards it fell 
        suddenly to less then 40 thousand pounds per Annum. Afterwards upon renewing the 
        warr & makeing a Peace between England and Spain 1629 it grew greater 
        then ever and continued so till the end of the warr 1648 the Silver Coynage 
        being about 440000li per annum and that of both gold and silver together above
        600000li per Annum. Then upon the conclusion of peace between Spain & Holland it fell again & became but the 8th or 10th part of what it 
        was before and continued so for the next 18 year being scarce 70000li per Annum 
        
         <616v> 
        
        till the Enacting of the Coynage Duty 1666 by which & the flourishing of trade 
        in the Peacefull reigns of Charles II & Iames II & the quick dispatch of business 
        by Paper Credit, Notwithstanding our disadvantageous trade with France it 
        Encreased till it became about 680000li per Annum. And then by the late 
        war with France & the Consequent decay of Paper Credit and trade 
        it decreased again Exceedingly. This agreement between the Encrease & 
        decrease of the Coynage and the state of the Nation in respect of peace & 
        war abroad shews that the Coynage has Principally depended on that state. And 
        if Paper Credit hath had any Effect upon the Coynage it has promoted 
        it because both increased together till 1690 and afterwards both decreased 
        together by the late French warr By the ordinary Course of trade the Coynage of Gold and Silver in the last 17 years of the reign of King Iames the 1st scarce Exceeded 40 or 50 thousand pounds per Annum. In the reign of King Charles the 1st it increased to an Exceeding great height not by the ordinary Course of trade but by our being in peace while our Neighbours were in war and supplyed themselves with provisions from England for carrying on that war. After 1647 when that was ceased and trade returned to its ordinary Course the Coynage (without recconing the recoyning of the Harp and Cross money) became but about 68000li per Annum one year with another till the rise and growth of paper Credit and the enacting of the Coynage duty 1667 and then in the space of 23 years more by the Encouragement of that Act and the Encrease of Trade occasioned by the quick dispatch of business by Paper Credit, the Coynage grew ten times greater then it was before And therefore Mr P. in his first Paper seems to have set the argument in a wrong light when he represented that the Coynage had decreased ever since the rise and growth of Paper Credit For he there Considers the Coynage of Silver alone and lessens it in the reign of King Cha. II & King Iac. II by taking a medium between that which preceded the French warr and that which was in the warr, whereas if he had considered the whole Coynage of both gold and silver and distinguished between times of Peace and warr, he would have found the argument from the Coynage to lye altogether in favour of paper Credit and of the Coynage duty Act as I represented in my former paper, the coynage by means of paper Credit & the Coynage Act growing ten times great then ever it was before
         < insertion from f 617r > by the ordinary course of trade, untill the late French warr put a stop to it < text from f 616v resumes >  But Mr P. (sect 18, 19) represents that if the Coynage Act had tended as much to the securing and keeping of our Coyn in the Nation as it did to Encourage Coynage the advantage I ascribe to that Act would have been without Contradiction but it is well known that the success has been otherwise, much of the Coyn having been melted down and Exported so that the little time of its circulation scarce made amends for the charge of Coynage & the Act it self incourageing the Coynage of Gold severall times over and the Merchant to Coyn in the dead months of Exportation what he intended to Export soon after so that there may  have been a great Coynage without any Addition to our stock. To all which I answer that trade like a river wears its self channells from which afterwards it Cannot easily be diverted That the designe of the Coynage Act was to derive the Channel of Gold and Silver through the English Mint & that if it had had that Effect in a notable manner as appears by the large coynage,  that this Act was not designed to prevent the Melting or Exporting

        of our moneys and therefore is not to be blamed for not preventing it & that the quantities of milled monies melted or Exported hath been nothing near so great as Mr. P. seems to represent For as for Guineas there could not be above a third part of them weighty enough for the cutting trade and all Importers did not cull but many weighty Guineas of King Cha. &  King Iames are still being notwithstanding their being lightned by wearing. In my former paper I recconed about 18th part culled out from melting. If I should say a fifth part yet the residue remaineing in the Nation in the year 1690 would be above five Millions. And so large a stock of Guineas is Confirmed by the plentifull appearance they made when they were at 30s apiece. And that this culling trade may be no more objected against the Coynage Act, tis now ceased by the exact sizing of the monies. The Milled silver monies of King Charles & King Iames is at present about an 8th. part of the whole Silver coyn (as I find by Examining severall parcells) and therefore in the time of the Recoynage of the hammered monies when thenew & old milled monies first mixed, amounted to about a Million. If in the six years preceding the recoynage there were about three Millions of silver monies Exported (for so I recconed in my former Paper  & I believe Mr P. will readily allow a much greater summ and if the better half of this was milled money, that being the weightiest, then there was above a million & an half of milled money exported in those six years & {thence} in the beginning of the year 1690 there was above two Millions and an half of milled silver monies in the nation which added to the five Millions of Gold makes above seaven millions and an half of Gold and Silver monies coyned in the first 23 years of the Coynage Act and remaining in the Nation till the year 1690 besides what was melted down and recoyned or Exported. And tho we should abate a million of this summ (which I see no reason to do) yet the remainder would be so great an Addition to our stock as abundantly makes good the argument from the Coynage in favour of the Coynage Act & Paper credit. Yet Mr. P. (sect. 13) upon my observing that the Coynage of both gold and silver fell very much soon after the beginning of the late warr, represents it as a thing well known that we had coyned but little silver (excepting what came from the wreck) for some years before. And therefore to set right this matter and put it out of dispute that the coynage of silver was large as well as that of gold till the beginning of that war, I have subjoyned the Mint accompt of the silver Coynage for every four years from  the Recoynage of the Harp and Cross money till the late Recoynage of the old hammered money. There were coyned in the Tower in silver milled monies By this Accompt it appears there was coyned in the 22 years of the Coynage Act from Dec 21 1667 when the Coynage Act began to operate,  to Dec 21 1689, the summ of 3277256. 3. 2 which abating by Estimation about half a Million for the wreck (for I have now forgot how much the wreck was vallued at) is after the rate of 126000li per Annum one year with another. And this Coynage notwithstanding the growing exportation of silver to the Indies held without any Considerable abatement till the beginning of the French war & there fell in one year to two or three thousand pounds per Annum which is less then the 20th part of what it was  before.  Or to speak more truly, the coynage which arose from over ballance of trade ceased that year. For the 3 or 4 thousand pounds per annum coyned afterwards were not imported by the Merchant  but bought with the Coynage Duty by the Master of the Mint. I have heard it represented that in China Gold is esteemed worth about 10 times its weight in Silver and that in a parcell of Gold of about 10 or 12 pound weight brought from China last summer the profit was about 60 per Cent. But if with Mr P. (sect 11) we say that the profit of Exporting silver to the Indies is but 25 per Cent more then that of Exporting Gold, tis a sufficient Encouragement to the Merchant to Export Silver rather then Gold  
            {I} do not say that our coynage of gold has sensibly increased by the exportation of silver to purchase it,  as Mr P. {(}sect 11) seems to understand me. I know but of one parcel of Gold  which has been brought hither from {illeg} But  I say that there have been large exportations of silver
            of above 120000 per Annum which is more then double to what it had ever been by the ordinary Course of Trade before  the growth of Paper Credit and Enacting of the Coynage duty. in the least seaven years of King Iames the I the silver Coynage amounted to 102981li. 9s. 8d. which is after the rate of about 15000li per Annum In the 19 years from the death of King Charles I to the end of the first year off the Coynage Act Dec 21 1667 it amounted to 922945li besides the 100000li for Dunkirk and this is after the rate of almost 50000li per annum But in the next 22 years by the joynt operation of the Coynage Act and Paper Credit it amounted on year with another to above 170000li per annum which great encrease shewes that the Mint Accompts which Mr P. in his first paper principally appeals to against paper Credit makes highly for that credit as well in the coynage of Silver as in that of Gold, notwithstanding that the Indies did sweep away the greatest part of our silver Bullion"

Mr Drummond had 45li sterling added to his salary by a Private Act which ceases with his life & therefore is not to be considered in the standing constitution of the Mint. The Generals Office is useless & may be joyned to the Wardens  upon the next voidance of  either place, which will save 270li per annum. Deduct this from the 850li & there will remain only  580li The enacting Clause which continues all the former Acts may be restrained to the Mint or Mints in England by inserting the words [with relation to the Mint or Mints in England] or some such words.

        Queen Ann, a Mint is to be continued in Scotland under the same 
        Rules as the Mint in England: Be it further enacted that all the money  arising in England by this Act 
        & also six per cent of all the moneys arising in England thereby
            shall be issued out of his Majestys  Exchequer to the Master & Worker or Masters & Workers of his Majestys 
        Mint or Mints in Scotland for the use & service of that Mint by such Order or Warrant as the like moneys arising in England by the Acts for encouragement of coinage

NB.  By the Act of the first Parliament of K. Iames VII 
        chap. XXIV, there  were allowed for salaries, maintaining the Fabric of the Mint house 
        providing of new Tools & other incident charges relating to the Mint 1200 pounds
        Scots & the overplus was for a free coinage of silver after the rate of 18
        pounds per stone. No provision for a free coinage of gold.  The 12000 pounds Scots reduced into English money (after the rate of 4s 6d to the 60 shillings piece{)}
amounts to 900li sterling, & by raising the Scots money at the union it amounts to 1000li (which raising ought not to affect England) & if the salary of the Clerk of the bullion amount to 333li. 13s. 4d scots & the providing of coining tools be deducted there will remain about 940li.

The company exporting so great quantities of Gold & Silver hath inhansed the price of Standard Silver from under five shillings the ounce to five shillings & four pence which is ten per cent, & a twenty shillings piece of broad Gold to twenty & four shillings which is twenty per cent, & Guinneys in proportion, which is so much in value above his Majesties coyn that it doth not only hinder the Bullion of Gold & Silver imported from being coyned, but hath occasioned all the weighty coyn to be culled out & melted into Bullion. So that there is not above fifteen or twenty pounds of currant money left in the Kingdom; which is not sufficient to manage the trade, which is reputed to be above forty millions a year. The free exporting of Gold & Silver & laying so great impositions by Mulet on all the commodities & Manufactures of this Kingdom hinders the exporting thereof; which hath brought down the prizes of Land, Lead, Tin, Wollen & other manufactures."

        of copper Moneys. 1. That six or at most seven hundred Tunns of copper moneys 
        are sufficient for all England, & I am of opinion that there is above 
         three quarters of that quantity now in the nation. 2. That whenever there shall be a coinage of such moneys, the 
            coinage do not exceed 20 or 30 or at most 40 Tunns per annum. For this money should 
            have time to spread eavenly without making a clamour any where 
            before the nation be sufficiently stockt. 3. That it be in the power of the Queen or Lord Treasurer to diminish 
            or stop the coinage at pleasure for preventing clamours if there should be 
            occasion. 4. That the moneys be coined in the Mint, it being unsafe to have coining 
            tools & coinage abroad. 5. That the moneys be well coined & a pound weight cut into no more then 
            twenty pence, least the ill form or lightness of the money be an encouragement 
            to counterfeiters. 6That about one seventh part of the moneys be in farthings. 7 That the master & worker for the time being be charged & discharged 
            by his Note as in the coinage of gold & silver. 8 That all the charge of copper, coinage, coining tools, wages & Incidents 
            be paid out of the profits of the coinage. 9 That the copper be paid  for out of the produce of the coinage within 
            three or four months after delivery 10 That if the copper upon the assay be not good the Master have power 
            to refuse it. 11 That the copper be coined without any mixture which may diminish its 
            price in the market if hereafter the moneys should be called in & melted down. 
            For the price of the metal in the market is the intrinsic value of the 
            money. And that not above three or four ounces of Tin be added to an 
            hundred weight of copper in fusion to make it run close. 12 That the master for the time being be allowed 5d per pound weight 
            for coinage by casting the blanks, or               per pound weight for 
            coinage by casting milling & sizing of barrs & cutting out the blanks as is 
            done in the coinage of gold & silver 13 That the surveyor of the meltings be paid by the number of melting 
            days & the Tellers by tale. 14 That the Importer above mentioned be paid by the Tunn  for all trouble & charge 
            in buying & importing the copper, & for coinage & porters & barrels & baggs & paper 
            & packthread & for putting away the copper money, & making up the account, 
            & that he bring in no particular account for any of these things. 15 Or if the Master be the Cashier & make up the account, that he 
            be allowed for his trouble & hazzard therein. 16 If her Majesty should think fit by Patent to grant away the profits 
            of the coinage above  all charges; there will be no need of an 
            Accountant or Teller or other Importer then the Patentee. But it was thought 
            fit in the reigns of King Charles & King Iames that the coinage should be uppon 
            account. And the Copper will be the better if paid for by her Majesty. And the 
            profits above the account may be given away (if it be thought fit) to whom 
            her Majesty pleases. 7. That on{e} or more persons be appointed to buy & import the copper by weight & receive it back in money by weight & tale & put the same away

Your Honours Petitioner serv'd out his time and faithfully discharg'd his Trust in both those Apprenticeships, therefore is surpris'd to find, that tho' he has undergon' a difficult servitude that of the Smith, he is not (tho' he should go on in that Work) to enjoy any more benefit then the other Monyers, who neither know nor do the least thing appertaining to that laborious Employ. Your Honours Petitioner has been inform'd, that those Persons who formerly officiated in his Business as Smiths, were Deputy Engineers to the Monyers, and had suitable sallarys given to them, there being a particular Assignment of Money in the Office for that Purpose; whereas Your Petitioner is allow'd two shillings per Diem only when he does Work, which is as little as the Laborers are allow'd by the Company tho' his fatigue much undoubtedly by believ'd to be considerably greater. The Company are so severe to Your Honours Petitioner as to deny him the Advantages themselves enjoy, for they pretend, unjustly to deprive him of the first Months share of their Profits after he had serv'd out his time of seven Years, by pleading it a Custom; but Your Petitioner is humbly of Opinion, that, had there been no Work for them in that time, or had there not considerable Advantages accrued to the Company in that Months Work, Your Honours Petitioner should not had this contention with the Company, nor been troublesome to Your Honour to right him in these Matters. Your Honours Petitioner humbly hopes, that as he has undergone the fatigue of two Apprenticeships in his seven Years, the Company may not be allow'd to take advantage of his Youth, by imposing their own Terms on him; he wholly relys on Your Goodness for redress, Your Honour being the intire Master, and to whom alone it belongs to direct in these Affairs; should he fail in this his Expectation of being  reliev'd by Your Honour, he can expect but little Iustice from the Company, as appears by what with humble submission he has presum'd to trouble Your Honour with, in the foregoing part of his Petition.

The Giant with many heads & hands signifies not a single person but a body politic & may represent any kingdom principality nation people or body of men with whom her Majesty hath or may have warr. The  device alludes to the ancient warr of the Golds & Giants. For the Egyptians commemorating the oldest of their warrs represented their Ancestors  in those warrs by Gods & their enemies by Giants invading heaven, & the Giants they painted with many heads & hands to signify that they were not single persons but bodies politic.  Iupiter they represented thundering against the Giants & when he was weary Pallas came in & carried on the warr according to that Motto, Vicem geit illa Tonantis.

That for silver is 512 sols or 437107 grains per Marc. p. 34. The proportion of fine Gold to fine Silver anno 1679 in France was 15 to 1. vizt fine ☉ = 437 Livres per Marc & fine silver 29liv.. 6sol.. 1112deniers. The King varied the proportion several times & anno 1690 the Marc of fine ☉ was valued at 457liv. 16sols & that of silver at 30 livres which is 151350 to 1. p 49, 50. The Seigniorage  in the reign of Lewis 13 was 6 Livres per Marc d'or & 1012 sols per Marc d'argent. In March 28 1679 it ceased but was reestablished Dec. 15 1689. p 58 The Brassage or charge of coyning is paid one half for the melting & other ordinary charges, the other half is paid to the Officers & Workers for their ministrie in the fabrication of the monies. It was paid by the Romans & anciently in France by a oublic tax upon the people whereby the Gold & Silver was of the same price coynd or uncoynd. And this were still to be wisht but at length the contrary has prevailed above the publick utility & the Brassage has been established. In the year 1676 it was 3 livres  per Mark of Gold & 18 sols per Marc of silver, at which time by the Kings Declaration of March 28 it ceased but was reestablished Dec 15 1689. The reasons for reestablishing the seigniorage & Brassage were 1 to prevent the exportation of the money 2 to prevent the melting it down for Goldsmiths uses. p 58, 59, 60, 61. The Ordinance of 1586 appoints the Goldsmiths work in silver to be 11den12 fine with a remedy of two grains & in Gold 22 Karats with a remedy of 14 Karats. And this continued till Decem 1679. The Goldbeaters & Wyerdrawers by the same Ordinance of 1586 use Gold of 24 Karats with a remedy of 14 Karats & Silver of 12 denar. with a remedy of 4gr. But by an Ordonnance of 1657 the Drawers in Lyons use a remedy of 6 grains in silver. By an Ordnance of Octob. 1689 the Refiners & Departers make silver at least 11denar. 18 grains fine & gold at least 232632 Karats p 61, 62, 63 The Goldsmiths that melt or abuse the money forfeit body & goods & by an Ordonnance of 1689 are condemned to the Galleys for ever. p 63. Rendage is what's rendred to the King & signifies the Seigniorage & Brassage together Traite is still more general & comprehends the Rendage & remedies of weight & allay together. p. 64 Dernier fort or Pied-fort is a piece of money perfect in weight & fineness without any remedy, made for a pattern. It has usually this inscription Exemplar probatœ monetæ

If any gold be imported which is not tough, he returns it back to be toughned at the Importers charge tho it be standard. If the gold or silver imported be uneavenly mixed or be too coarse, he returns it to be remelted or refined at the Importers charge. 
        
        
        
        And by parity of reason  he should not be obliged to receive all sorts of copper to be coined. If it be too coarse or too hard or want malleability or be ill coloured or otherwise faulty, he should be at liberty to return it back to the owner to be made fit for the Mint at the owners charge; 
            
            
       
       Otherwise it  will be
                
                exceedingly difficult & almost impracticable to coin the money of good malleable copper 
                
                 2 
        
        There is an  assay of copper by refining a small parcel & thence recconing what will be the wast & charges in refining a Tunn of such copper, & setting a value  upon it accordingly. And such an Assay is useful in buying coarse copper to be refined, but is of no use in  buying fine copper. The price of fine copper depends upon the malleability, & two parcels of  copper  which by such an assay are equally fine may differ very much in
        
         <303v> 
        
        their malleability, & by consequence in their price.  There may be a {penny} a pound difference in their price. 3. All coarse copper is hard & brittle & in refining it begins to be called fine copper when it begins to be soft & malleable. They that refine it frequently take out of the mass in fusion  with an iron spoon a little parcel & hammer it when red hot. And so soon as it hammers {into} a think plate without cracking, they hammered into a  square rod  of a convenient thickness & bend it when cold &  breaking of a piece {illeg} the grain & colour where it breaks & by the malleability grain & colour judge of its fineness, & accordingly set the price. The malleability is the chief Test, the grain colour  are further indications of the goodness of the Copper. And when they find the Copper sufficiently malleable to beare hammering & rolling into vessels & plates they value it at about 1114d or 1112d per pound weight averdupois, & call it fine copper. And of such copper hammered & rolled the Swedes make their money. Some are so skilful in refining copper that they make it still  more malleable so as to fit it into  be drawn into wire, & then the wire-drawer gives two or three shillings a pound for it accordingly as he finds it less or more  ductile & fit to be drawn into wire. And some observe that in making of brass the finest or most malleable & ductile copper takes up most of the Lapis calaminaris & thence conclude that the finest copper may be assayed by observing how much of the Lapis it dr{an}ks up. ut this way of assaying is troublesome & not yet in use, nor exact enough to be trusted in a Mint by reason of the different goodness of the Lapis. The malleability & ductility of fine copper is that which sets a price upon it & therefore is the truest Assay Copper refined to that degree & in that manner as to be malleable without cracking when red hot is the  & the fittest material for  all sorts of copper vessels & for copper money. The Swedish copper money is of this standard; 
        
        
        
        And if the English copper money be of the same standard a pound weight will be worth about 1114 or 1112 at the Warehouses, & if it be made much more malleable the Wire drawer will 2 or 3 shillings a pound for it because of its fitness for his use. Tis the ductility that makes it useful & the usefullness that  sets a price upon it, & the tryal by hammering & bending hot & cold that determins the ductility.  Copper in not malleable till it begins to be fine. In refining copper the Refiner takes out an iron spoonful from time to time and tries it by the hammer & the bending & by the grain & colour in breaking untill  by those signs he finds the copper to be fully fine & ready to vitrify. And then he lades it out into iron {pawns}. This is
                        
             <294r> 
        
                 the trial in refining copper & by consequence the proper trial  of fine copper fit to be coyned into copper money. To the most Honourable the Earl of Oxford & Earl Mortimer Lord High Treasurer of great Britain.  May it please your Lordship  I humbly beg leave to lay before your Lordship that the Master & 
        Worker of her Majestys Mint is not obliged to receive all the gold & 
        silver brought into her Majestys Mint to be coyned. If any gold be brought 
         in which is not tough, he returns it back to be toughned 
        at the Importers charge tho it be standard. If any gold or silver 
        be not eavenly mixed he returns it back to be remelted at the 
        Importers charge. If it be not neare to standard he returns it 
        back to be refined at the Importers charge. And to judge whether 
        it be fit to be received or returned back is left to his discretion. 
        And by parity of reason he should not be obliged to receive all 
        sorts of copper to be coyned. If it be not fine or not tough & 
        malleable or ill coloured or otherwise faulty, he should be at 
        liberty to return it back  to be made fit for the 
        Mint at the Importers charge. Otherwise it will be difficult to coyn the money of good malleable copper, without allowing for the 
            charge loss & hazzards  of such an undertaking. There is an assay of copper by refining a small parcel & thence 
        recconing what will be the wast  charges & trouble in refining a Tunn of such 
        copper. And such an Assay is 
        usefull in buying coarse copper to be refined, but is of little or no use in 
        buying fine copper. The price of fine copper depends upon the malleability & two parcels of copper  equally 
        fine may differ very much in their  malleability, & by 
        consequence in their price. Copper refined to that degree & in that 
        manner as to be malleable  without cracking when 
        red hot is the fittest material for manufacturing into all sorts of 
        copper vessels & by consequence for money. The Swedish copper  money is of this standard.  And such copper is usually 
        valued at about 1112d per pound weight. And if it be made still more soft & 
        malleable the wiredrawer may value it at 2 or 3s per pound weight because 
        of its fitness for his use. Tis the ductility that makes it usefull 
        & the usefulness that sets a price upon it & the triall by  hammering & bending hot & cold that determins 
        the ductility. This is the assay by which the Refiners of copper 
        know when their copper is fully fine & ready to vitrify & by 
        consequence the proper assay for receiving fine copper into the 
        Mint. For it determins the fineness & the malleability at once, 
        no coarse copper being malleable. By the estimates of Workmen the charges of repairing & fitting up the houses in the Irish Mint for a  coynage of Copper 
        will amount to about 146li . And the putting up a furnace in 
        the melting house with all things answerable for making an experiment 
        in casting will cost about 32li more. And a small parcel of copper 
        
         <313r> 
        
        for making an experiment may cost about 20li more. If your Lordship please to impress 
        200li to me for this service upon account, it may be repaid out of the copper 
        coynage. All which &c Mint Office 12 Mar 1713"

e farther humbly certifie to your Lordship that by the accounts of the sale of Tin it doth appear that in the four last years there has been sold at a medium about 1560 Tuns Stannary Weight per annum, which is less then the quantity received annually from both Cornwall and Devonshire by about 80 Tuns per annum, and it may be recconed that near the same Quantity will  be yearly sold during the present Warr, but we may reasonnably h{illeg} that in time of peace a  quantity will go off, and that it may amount to Two hundred Tuns per annum, or more. Total Total Gained by her Majesty In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of Nov. 9th instant  upon the anne{xed} petition of  several Gentlemen in Cornwall  about renewing the contract for Tin we have considered the same & are humbly of opinion that if the contract  be not made for a greater  quantity of Tin then  the consumption shall annually carry off: her Majesty may  without loss give 3li 10s per  stannary weight, the  Tinners paying the coynage Duty & Post Groats or an equivalent: &  the interest of money advanced  upon the Tin being reckoned at no more then 5 per cent.
          And we are humbly of opinion that the  consumption of Tin in the next contract will in times of war be much the same that it has been in this & the three last years which at a medium has amounted to about 1500              Tunns of Tinn per annum stannary weight. But what it   will be in times of peace we are not {illeg}bled to judge by any experience. Yet considering that Tin is  conveyed through other countries  into France & Spain  the only countries with which we have not a free trade at present & that the consumption of Tin in those two countries (by the Custome house books) amounted only to about       Tunns per annum befor the war began, we are  not yet satisfied that in times of peace the consumption will exceed 1600 Tunns per annum. To the Right Honourable the Lord High Treasurer of great Britain.  May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of the 9th instant upon the annexed representation of the Gentleman owners of Tin lands in Cornwall to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries relating to a new contract for Tinn: we humbly represent that by the course of the sale of Tin this & the four last years there has been sold in Cornwall & London at a medium about 1560 tunns per annum stannary weight, which being deducted from 1600 Tunns received annually from Cornwall, & allowing 40 tunns more for Devonshire, there hath remained about 80 Tunns yearly unsold, so that 1520 tunns of Cornish Tinn  has been sold yearly, more or less; and if the same course of the sale continues, there will remain at the end of the present contract so much tinn unsold as at the rate of 3li 16s per  averdepois will  produce about 180000li. And so long as the same course of sale continues, if six per cent (the interest of the moneys now advanced to the owners of Tinn-lands) be allowed upon the said dead stock of 180000 & the coinage duty & post groats be paid, & 1400li been accounted sufficient  to answer accidents & unforeseen charges, her Majesty may without losing by the contract give 3. 9. 6 per  stannary weight for 1520 tunns of tinn the quantity annually consumed, as will appear by the following account. Total If it be supposed that the consumption may carry annually 1600 or 1800 tunns stannary: it will appear by the like recconing upon  that supposition, that her Majesty may give 3li 10s in the first case & 3li. 11s in the second, & so in proportion to a greater or less consumption But every 100 tunns purchased above what the consumption will carry off makes a dead stock annually increasing, the interest of which at 6 per cent will in the end of seven years amount to about ten thousand pounds. To the Right Honourable the Lord High Treasurer of great Britain.  May it please your Lordship,  In Obedience to your Lordships Order of reference of the 9th nstant upon the annexed representation of the Gentlemen Owners of Tin Lans in Cornwall to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries wherein they desire that a Convocation or Parliament or Tinners may be holden before the determination of the present contract, that proper measures may be taken to set another on foot at such price as that her Majesty may be no loser thereby, and by which such further quantity of Tin beyond the present stipulation be taken as may prevent the inconveniences they now labour under upon that account: We humbly represent to your Lordship that by the course of 
        the sale during this and the four last years there will remain at the end of the present contract a dead stock of Tin which at 3li 16s per  averdupois will be worth about 180000li. And that if her Majesty contracts for 1600 Tunns of Tin annually at 3li 10s per  stannary weight, without remitting the coinage duty & post groats & this quantity shall be sold off annually so that the dead stock of 180000li may more or less remain the same during all the next contract: And if 6 per cent (the interest now paid in Cornwall for moneys advanced to them by her Majesty) be allowed upon the dead stock: the state of the contract will be as follows. In this recconing if 10800li should be thought too great an interest upon dead stock, 1458li 18s is as much too little for insurance & other accidents & unforeseen charges. In this & the four last years the sale of the Tin by our accounts hath at a medium amounted to about 1560 Tunns per annum stannary weight, which being deducted from 1600 Tunns received annually from Cornwall & about 44 Tunns received annually from Devonshire, leaves 84 Tunns stannary, or 90 Tunns averdupois, the value of which at 76li per Tunn is 6840li, to be annually added to the dead stock. And the interest of this addition, if the contract should continue seven years, amounts to 8618li. 8s, besides the loss by the fall of the price in the end of the contract, which would amount to 13860li or more if the Tin should then fall for  2li. 14s per  averdupois or less, the markets being then clogged by the joint sale of the dead stock & the Tin in Cornwall Thus the Crown by contracting for 1600 Tunns of Tin per annum at 3li 10s per  would lose in the space of seven years 22478li 8s or above & this loss in four years more would be more then doubled We have grownded this recconing upon a supposition that the sale of the Tin will continue uniform to the end of this & the next contract. How much it may increase or decrease by peace or wars or other causes, we do not know; & without a certainty can make no estimate of what may be got or lost.

But the Tin was sold by the Queens Officers to merchants by Tunns averdupois each Tun consisting of 2240 pounds averdupois. The Queen paid 65 pounds per Tun stanary weight besides  the Coynage & post groats amounting to 4li 6 8 per Ton which she remitted to the people of Cornwal And she  sold about 1260 Tunns averdupois to the merchant annually at 76li per Ton. And in the beginning of this a contract the Queen had 2400 Tuns averdupois remaining in her hands upon a former contract. At her Majestys death there were about 5240 Tunns Averdupois of Tin left in the hands of Trustees for paying debts upon the Tin & civil list. Case 1. If the contract should crease,  the Trustees & Cornwall by selling against one another will bring down the price of Tin In the time of the 1st contract the sales amounted to about 1500 Tuns averdupois per cent During the last 4 years there has been sold annually about 1260 Tunns  of Tin averdupois or almost 1200 Tuns stannary weight. The price was  76li per Tun Averdupois. Case 1. There were about 5200 Tuns of Tin  left by her Majesty in the hands of Trustees to be sold for paying her debts, the Trustees & Cornwall by selling against one another will bring down the price to what it hath been formerly or  suppose to 40 or 50li per Tun, or perhaps lower. And if  the Trustees & Cornwall should both together sell about 1260 Tunns  1300T per annum, & each of them sell as much as the other, the Queens Tin would be eight years in selling. Case 1 For bringing this matter to a recconing  I will suppose that the Trustees may sell about 650 Tuns per annum  at 54li per Tunn & the sale will bring in 32500li for eight years together. And this annuity rebating interest at 5 per cent will be worth in ready money 210054li the neare value of the  Queens Tin at present upon the afforesaid suppositions, if the contract ceases. The Trustees sell 650 Tunns per annum must fall their price so low that it will not be worth the while to raise above 650 Tuns  per annum in all Cornwall per annum. And in this case Tin will scarce sell for 45li per annum & the  owners of the Tinn lands will be much discontented. Case 2 On the other hand  if the contract be renewed & the King takes off annually 1840 Tunns stannary as in the last contract, there will be every year an addition to the dead stock of Tin of the Crown of about 664 Tunns stannary weight or 712 Tunns averdupois  which the longer the contract is continued the greater will the complaint  & discontent of the Cornish men whenever it breaks off & the greater will be the loss of the crown.  Case 3. If  his Majesty should renew the contract & take only 1200 Tunns stannary weight from Cornwall & Devonshire annually & which is much as will go off to the Merchant & pay the Queens Trustees annually about 32000 per annum eight years together The recconing would stand thus Total charge annually Iust before the beginning of the first contract for Tyn the Pewterers  furnished themselves with  Tyn from Cornwall & being factors for the merchants sold off their own Tin first so that the Queen sold very little Tyn the first year. I reccon that their Tyn sold that year & the first quarter of the second year might amount to about 1400 Tuns stannary weight. At the end of 612 years, the time of that contract there remained  about 2400 Tunns averdupois that is 224 Tunn  Stannary in the Queens hands unsold. She had then received 612 years produce that is 10660 Tunns stannary weight  & therefore sold 8420 Tunns. Add the 1400 Tunns of the Pewterers & the whole quantity sold in six 12 years will be about 9820, which is after the rate of about 1510 Tunns stannary weight per annum. In the four last years there has been sold after the rate of only 1260 Tunns per annum Averdupois that 1176 Tuns stannary weight.   The reason of the decrease of the sale I take to be the high price of the Tin &  that  where Tin could not be imported during the war, the people learnt to use  other vessels then Tin & now being impoverished by the warr  are less able to purchase Tin vessels then formerly & content themselves with vessels of wood & earth. The dead stock left by the Queen at her death amounts to about 5240 Tunns averdupois. If the contract should not be renewed, this Tin will scarce be sold for above 40 or 50li per Tun & if it should be sold for 45li per Tunn, & 1260 Tunns averdupois should be sold annually,  the one half by Cornwall the other half by the Trustees for the Queens Tin, the Queens Tin would be eight years & four months in selling, & for so long time would  produce annually 28350li  for paying off the Queens debts untill 5240 Tunns be sold off & all the payments amount unto 235800li the price of the whole. At a higher price the Tin would go off slower at a lower price it would go off faster,  & what is got by the time of sale would be lost by the price quam proxime. If the  Commissioners for the sale of Tynn should   sell all the Tin to the King for 240000li to be paid by quarterly payments of 7500li at each payment for eight years together: their bargain in my opinion would be more advantageous then to let the contract cease. For if the contract be not renewed they will scarce be able to sell 630 Tunns per annum for 45li per Tunn & out of the price they must defray the charges of warehouse room, factors, Porters & Incidents. If therefore the contract be not renewed the sale of Tin may amount unto about 630 Tunns averdupois or 600 stannary weight & bring into Cornwall about 240000li in eight years or 28000li per annum till all the Queens Tin be sold. And if his Majesty should purchase only 400 Tuns stannary weight per annum  at 3li 9s per  it would {be} more to their advantage. For it would
        bringto  Cornwall 27{6}00li in eight years, & save them the charges of diffing of 200 Tunns stannary weight annually  above the 400 Tunns  Cornwall therefore ought to thank the king if he should contract with them for 600, 800 or 1000 or 1200 Tunns annually they ought to thank him much more, &  shew themselves very sensible of the favour before any contract be made. Twelve hundred Tunns Stannary weight as much as will go off & as the king can purchase without losing by it. The recconing stands thus. Total expence If his Majesty should receive annually from Cornwall only 1000 or 800 or 600 or even but 400 Tunns annually from Cornwall at 69li 6. 8 per Tun including the coynage & post Groats, it would be better for Cornwall then to let the contract quite cease. And therefore they have reason to take it as an Act of grace if his Majesty should contract with them for no more then 800 or 1000 Tunns per annum. And tho his Majesty should pay an annuity   eight years together to the Trustees for the Queens Tin, yet it will not be necessary that the contract with Cornwall should be for above three years.  If the king renews the Queens contract, which is for 1800li Tonns stannary weight from Cornwall & about 40 Tunns from Devon; he will  
        sell no Tin till all the Queens Tin is sold,  which will be in about 4 years & two months recconed from the Queens death; & at the end of that time he will have in his hands 7667 Tuns stannary weight or 8215 Tuns merchant weight,  & so be in a much worse condition then the Queen was  at the time of her death. This Tin will cost the King 569563li besides freight 7667li & charges in Cornwall 10000li,  & interest of the money advanced 55000. In all  643030li. The interest of which money at 5 per cent would be 32151li per annum after the Queens Tin is sold off. And if the contract should then cease  & Cornwall should sell but 4 or 5 hundred Tunns per annum & the King should {sell} 800 Tunns per annum at 40s per  till all is sold, the produce of the sales for the king would only pay the interest, & the king would lose the principall amounting to 643030li.  Considerations upon the Contracts for Tin.  the last contract for Tin commencing Iune 1st 1710 & ending with the Queens death Aug 1st 1714 was for 1800 Tunns per annum from Cornwall in times of peace besides about 40 Tunns from  Devon. And the consumption carried off  almost 1200 Tuns stannary weight per annum & at her death there remained  in her hands unsold about 5150 Tuns  merchants weight. If the contract be renewed by the Prince & assigned over to the King the Queens Tin will be at least four years  in selling &  at the end of that time the King will have received 7360  stannary weight or 7886 Tuns merchants weight, & so be in a much worse condition as to these contracts then the Queen was at her death. This Tin will cost the King 511520li, besides feight 7360li & charges in Cornwall & 1000li &  interest of  all the money advanced  at 5 per cent 51988li. In all 571868li 
before the king can begin to sell any Tin. And then the interest of this money at 5 per cent will amount unto 28573 per annum If at the end of that time, the contract should cease: the King, that he may sell as much Tin as shall be sold by the people of Cornwall, suppose 600 Tunns per annum, (the whole sales amounting only to 1200 Tuns standard weight,) he must lower the price untill it shall not be worth the while for the people of Cornwall to dig & work above 600 Tunns  per annum.  When the price has been only 50li per Tun they have dug a much greater quantity And therefore the king must sell it at a price still lower, suppose at 45 or 40  per Tun. If he should sell  it at 45li per Tun. The sale of 600 Tunns per annum would produce an annuity of 27000  till all the Kings Tin be sold, that is, for 12 years & a a quarter. Which Annuity  would not pay the interest of the money advanced  together with the charges of selling the Tin  & in the end of the time htere will be nothing left to satisfy the King for the 571868li. And if he would sell the Tin faster he must sell it for a  price still lower & thereby increase the discontent of Cornwall. So  a renewal of the contract for only four years would create a loss to king of above half a million of money. And if it be still greater,  besides that it will every year grow more & more difficult to put an end to these contracts without ruining Cornwall."

For he has no trial piece of his own but performs his Assays by their Trial pieces & in their present & his Assays without their approbation are of no force. In overseeing his Assays the Warden & Comptroller act in behalf of the Queen & her people & the Master acts for himself: & the Assaymaster acts only as a manual Artificer & is to act with skill & sincerity  to the satisfaction of the Officers of both parties. For its easy for an Assayer to give a turn to the Assay, of a quarter of a grain or an halfpenny weight or above, for or against the Master. And if any such thing be suspected, the Assayer must repeat his Assay till the Officers of the Mint are satisfied of his acting with skill & candour. And if any Importe{r} think himself aggr{ieved} he hath a remedy prescribed, which is an appeal not to persons not concerned, but to a trial by the Wardens Trialpiece. It was right therefore for the Lord High Treasurer to refer the four Petitioners to a triall before the Officers of the Mint as the proper judges of their qualifications in print of skill. Now the direction given to Mr Brattle were no other then those given to his brother Her Majestys late Assaymaster two years before his death & they have been executed more exactly by the present Mr Brattle then by his brother, & they were to  coin by the Trial piece of K. Iames. The Pot Assay pieces of the Gold coined  after the Trial of the Pix 1710 untill those directions were given being melted down together & assayed with that triall piece  were found to agree with it, the ballance standing at the cock. And all the Gold money coined since that Trial of the Pix being lately tried by the same Trial piece,  the Iury found them equal in fineness the scales standing at the cock. And After the money hath been found  well coined by a Iury, the Master of the Mint hath a legal right to be quiet against all the Queens subjects for what is past. To err within the Remedy is no crime. It only creates a  a reconning between the Queen & the Master. If the Master has got by the error he must refund his profit to the Queen: if he has lost, the Queen returns his loss. And if the error be under a quarter of a grain or an halfpenny weight, it is neglected by ancient custome & creates not so much as a recconing. If the error be by designe the  only punishment is that the Master must be at teh charge of recoining the mony before delivery. If it be without designe the money is deliverable notwithstanding, provided the error be within the remedy. But nothing less then a quarter of a grain {us}es to be recconned an error or taken notice of in the received method of assaying. The Iury takes no notice of any thing less. All the bullion is received by the Masters Triall-piece. And if the Importer shal at any {time} think himself aggrieved by the Masters assay, he hath  an appal to the wardens trial piece. This is his proper remedy & his only remedy against the Master. But if the Importers do not appeal, there is no reason why those that are not Importers nor have anything to do with the Mint should be allowed to complain.  They may admonish the Importers to appeale but that have not so much as a right to appeal themselves, or to give the Officers of the Mint any molestation. For the coinage is not to be made   impracticable. When Mr Brattel & Mr Oadham had a comparative Trial before the Officers of the Mint, they made each of them eight assays of Gold in four successive fires, two in 
        
         <100v> 
        
        each fire, & as many of silver. Some of Mr Oadhams assays  taken from one & the same piece of gold differed from others a quarter of a grain, & one of them erred two grains which is three times the Remedy, & the error was in fineness & therefore not likely to be by mere accident. Whereas all Mr Brattles Gold assays agreed perfectly with one another except one which differed from the rest only about the twelft part of a grain, which is but the eighth part of the Remedy. And almost all the coinage is in gold. Mr Brattle was also observed to handle things with more dexterity & dispatch At that time Mr Oadham was offered a fuller trial by more assays & did not then desire it, but has since desired another trial. Had acknowledged the fairness of that trial, & that he had since been learning to assay better & was now grown more skilfull then before his request might have been granted without a reflexion upon the Mint: but he pretends to have learnt his skill long ago in his Apprenticeship & has appealed from the Report of the Officers, If declining a Trial by an objection against some of the Petitioners, appealing from the Report of the Officers & labouring is a greater objection against Mr Oadham. & now in opposition to it produces a certificate of his skill in assaying signed by Merchants & Goldsmiths. But it doth not appear that his subscribers are men of note for skill in assaying or ever met to see him make a competent number of successive assays whereby they might judge of his skill. They are merchants, shopkeepers & plateworkers & generally trust the assays of the Hall. The Importers are proper Iudges not of hte skill of an Assaymaster but whether they will freely trust him with their bullion. Amongst his subscribers there are only six who have imported gold within these three years, & all of them together have imported only to the value of about 14 thousand pounds: whereas the Importers who have signed a paper for Mr Brattle (as I am credibly informed, for I have not sen it) have imported to the value of  eight or nine hundred thousand pounds within that time. All the Importers trust Mr Brattel freely with their bullion, but Mr Oadhams credit is not yet established among them. And a miscariage in the Assay-Office  would be a discoragement to the coinage. It was very right therefore for the Lord High Treasurer to refer  all the Petitioners to a trial before the Officers of the Mint & it was not right in Mr Oadham to appeal from their Report  
        
         < insertion from lower down f 101r > to defame them & to make an interest against them. The increase of the coin depends upon the credit  of the Officers with Importers & this credit is at present very good & its the interest of the Government to support it. To say that Mr Brattel being under the direction of the Officers of the Mint hath acted partially, is to object against the very constitution of the Mint. For the Queens Assaymaster is & ought to be as much under the direction of the Officers in assaying the money as Mr Brattel is at present. And the directions given < text from f 101r resumes > 
        
        reflect upon them & endeavour to carry his point by interest. If declining a Trial be an objection against {illeg}a of the  Petitioners  appealing from a Report of the Officers to the proper Iudges is a greater objection against Mr Oadham. The directions given to Mr Brattel  against all the Queens subjects for what is past.  Before the late trial of the Pix the Master of the Mint  for obviating complaints which might arise, ordered the money for the Assay to be kept from time to time to be reassayed by the Queens Assaymaster so soo as there should be one appointed by her Majesty. And now he ordered the like to be done for the future.  Which is the utmost care that he can take for the satisfaction of people in this matter & for keeping up the credit of the Mint. All the Bullion is received by the Masters trial piece. And if the Importer at any time thinks himself injured by the Masters  Assays he hath a remedy appointed by law, which remedy is an appeal to the Wardens trial piece. But the Importers do not appeal & if they do not complain of the Masters assays, those that are not Importers nor have any thing to do with the Mint should not be allowed to complain. By the constitution of the Mint the Master & Worker receives & coins all the Bullion of gold & silver by his own trial-piece. The Importer hath at all times an Appeal from the Masters Assays to a trial by the Wardens trial piece: And the Queen & all her people have an Appeal to the Trial piece of the Exchequer at every trial of the Pix. If any Importer is dissatisfied with the Masters Assays & will appeale to a trial by the Wardens Trial piece: the Queen & Council or the Lord High Treasurer may appoint any indifferent person or persons skilled in Assaying  to stand by & see the whole Trial. But if the Importers do not complain, Mr Oadham & his friends who are not Importers have no right  to appeal complain or intermedde with the Mint. They & all the Queens subjects will have justice done them at the next trial of the Pix. And in the mean time  they are not to discourage the  importation of bullion into her Majestys Mint. But if they desire a hearing before the Queen & Council, the Officers of the Mint  do not decline it."

        we have perused the annexed Memorial of the Master of her Majesties Mint at Edingburgh, and 
        humbly represent that Gold and silver ought to be in the Ingot when imported into her Majesties Mint in the Tower, and if it be not in the Ingot the owner causes it to be melted into Ingots by whom he pleases and at his own charge and bears the loss by wast; And this must be done before the Master and Worker can receive it from him by weight and Assay upon his Note in Order to Coin it and therefore is never done at the Masters Charge. According to this Method the publick did bear the whole loss by this Melting in the late Recoinage of the hammered moneys in England, and the same should be now born by the Importers in Scotland and placed among the losses mentioned in the Act of Vnion in these words. 
        It is agreed that in the first place out of the aforesaid summ: (that is out of the Equivalent) what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any losses which private persons may Sustein by reduceing the Coin of Scotland to the Standard and value of the Coin of England, may be made good.
  And therefore we are humbly of Opinion that if the Bank of Scotland for receiving the old moneys and three Commissioners for inspecting {the Melting t}hereof be paid out of the Equivalent (as we are credibly informed) Mr. Allardes for performing the Melting should also be paid out of the same Fund. And we conceive a penny per pound weight Troy to be a reasonable allowance for this Melting, it being the usuall price which Merchants pay the Goldsmiths for melting their Silver into Ingots in London. The Charge of refining the Coursest Ingots to bring the rest to standard being very uncertain is always reckoned among the Incident charges, and allowed to the Master in his Accounts. And we are humbly of Opinion that moneys be advanced from time to time to the Master for enabling him to bear this charge. In recoining the Forreign moneys it may amount to about 3d. per pound weight. In recoining those of Scotland it's inconsiderable. The Moneyers are allowed ten pence halfpenny per pound weight for marking and Coining the moneys in the Tower and could not be prevailed with to send some of their body from their familys and from their Farmes to the Mint at Edingburgh upon lower terms (for coining only) then those allowed in her Majesties Warrant, whereof 9d. per pound weight is the same allowance for Coinage as in the Tower and the charges above 9d. (which may amount to about three farthings or a penny per pound weight during the Coinage) are an Extraordinary allowance made for encourageing the moneyers and should therefore be placed among the Incident charges and money be advanced to the Master on this Account.

            two Ecus & 2 or 3 sols of France, that is at 9s 2d or 9s 3d. 
            At which rates a Guinea is worth about 20s 09d12. There also

            16s 1012d. At which rate a Guinea is worth 21s. 023d. But gold was 
            lately higher in France then at present which might raise
            the price of Lewidors at Geneva. At Genoa the Croisat goes for 712 lires and is worth 6s 6d34 &
            therefore the Lire of Genoa is 10d12. And there the Pistole is valued at

The copper & making of the blanks cost 18d, the stamping 1d,  & a penny moer was allowed for the Graver Smith & incident charges. 3 A pound weight of fine English copper such as will hammer when red hot will cost 1012d or 1{0}34 in silver moneys, the same may be coyned without edging for edging for 512d or 534 including the work of the Graver & Smith. the whole charge of copper & coinage is not above 1612d per pound weight & if the same be edged the edging will cost a penny more. And if a pound weight be cut into 20d there will remain at least 2d12 per pound weight for purchasing Mills & presses & setting up a copper Mint & paying Checks & all incident charges. 1 If copper be mixed with any other  base metal or semi-metal it will not endure the hammer when red hot but fly in pieces. So soon as it is refined by the copper workers to that degree  as to be purged from all other base metal it begins to endure the hammer when red hot & to  be worth about  98 or 100li per Tunn  & such copper They call fine copper.

The barrs to stand the test of the hammer when made red hot.  Such barrs will be something cleaner then those made by casting the copper in  molds of sand & milling them in the Mint, but will be dearer by about a penny in the pound weight. 4  The Mills Presses & other Engins for setting up a Copper Mint will cost  six or seven hundred pounds & three farthings in the  pound weight in coining an hundred Tunns will pay that charge. 5 Weighing & telling may cost 18d per pound weight, paper A pound weight of fine copper, such as will endure the assay abovementioned will cost 1012d or 1034d & the coynage will cost 512d or 534d including the work of the graver & smith, so that the whole charge of copper & coinage will  scarce exceed 1612d per pound weight.

II chap. 5 saith that no moneys leviable & payable by this Act shall be applied or converted to any use or uses whatsoever other then to the defraying the charge or expence of the Mint or Mints & of the Assaying melting down wast & coinage of Gold & Silver & this encouragement of bringing in of Gold & Silver into the  said Mint or Mints there to be coyned &c. The first is the charge of supporting a standing Mint, the second is the further charge of carrying on the coynage in that Mint. And by the next clause of the Act the first is limited to 3000li for preventing needless extravagance & the other is left unlimited for encouraging the coynage. The words are: And it is hereby further enacted that there shall not be issued out of the Exchequer of the said moneys, in any one year, for the fees & salaries of the Officers of the Mint or Mints & towards the providing maintaining & repairing of the Houses Offices & Buildings & other necessaries for assaying melting down & coyning above the summ of three thousand pounds sterling money, & the overplus of the said moneys so kept or to be kept as aforesaid shall  be employed for & towards the expence wast & charges of assaying melting down & coynage & buying in of gold & silver to be coyned, & not otherwise. Here the charge of salaries & buildings with their appurtenances necessary for constituting a Mint, (such as are Hearths & Chimneys convenient for furnaces, floors convenient for Mill-rooms, blocks convenient for the Presses & Flatters, benches convenient for the Cutters & for the Graver & Smith, Tables convenient for sizing & for Weighing & telling, stalls & Desks for the Clerks to rate & standard, money chests & boxes for the Treasury & Pix, Locks for the Offices, Gates for the Mint & Wells Pumps & Pipes for water) are limited to 3000li. And the overplus is for defraying the charges arising by the coynage, such as are the charge of stationary ware for the Clerks, ballances & weights for the severall Offices, Furnaces, Cuppels, water-silver, Aqua fortis & Charcoal for the Assay-Office, Refining & Allay for bringing the gold & silver to standard, Flasks furnaces melting & wast in the Melting houses, Mills Dyes coining & wast in other Offices, Indentures & Warrants for carrying on the coynage, & charges of making Tryal-pieces & trying the Pix. After the making of this Act, the salaries upon the establishment of the Indenture of the Mint amounted unto 2600li & there remained only 400li for the providing & repairing of buildings, which charge in the old Accounts usually amounted unto two or three & sometimes almost four hundred pounds per annum, or within 20 or 25li over or under. And there is an Article in the Indenture which obliges the Master to pay unto the Warden such summ & summs as are payable by him for salaries & repairs & such other expences of the Mint as have been heretofore usually paid by him. The Act made in the 4th & 5th year of her Majestys reign for en <337v> larging the summe of 3000li. to that of 3500li was not intended to charge the 3000li with any sort of payments which had not been used to be put upon it, but on the contrary to make more room for bearing those sorts of payments which used to be put upon it as the words of the Preamble of the Act import. And accordingly a new salary of 400li per annum was setled upon the Moneyers presently after the passing of the Act. And the salaries of the Clerks of the Mint being thought too small were intended to be augmented. But it was thought fit first to take care of the old buildings which were ready to fall. And since that time there has been spent upon rebuilding about 900li or 1000li. As a part of the charge of rebuilding the Engineers shop comes into the Account of the year 1712. In the Account of that year the salaries upon the Indenture payable by the Warden are 1435li, those payable by the Master to the Officers under him 1080li, to the Smith 40li in lieu of 50li, to the Graver for an Apprentice 35li in lieu of 95li. The new salary to the Moneyers is 400li. And the charges of the buildings in the Wardens Account are in one Article 389li. 2s, in another 11li. 13s. 6d. Total 3390li. 15s. 6d."

On these accounts the Officers of the Mint (Mr Neale, Mr Hall mentioned in the Petition & my self) then recommended him earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury as a very fit person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the two late Comptrollers in that time of great business, and when the Comptrollers in that time of great business and when the Comptrollers insisted on Mr Beresford a stranger. Mr Haynes was appointed to take care of the Comptrollers business till Mr Beresford could qualify himself.

I desire that his character may by any friend who best knows it be put into the hands of the Officers of the Mint who are ready to examin it & make a report thereof to your Lordships. All which is most humbly submitted &c To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury.  May it please your Lordships Vpon your Lordships Reference of the 7th of August last concerning the qualifications of the Petitioners for the Weigher & Teller's place  I humbly conceive it not remote  from our  business as Officers of the Mint to give your Lordships what light we can into the matter by laying before your Lordships faithfully & according to the best of our knowledge or information the qualifications & services of the Petitioners in Mint affairs: in which respect one of them at least deserves in  justice a particular character. Mr Haynes has been in the Mint about 14 yeares except two short intermissions & while he acted there had a general reputation amongst us for integrity, sobriety good humour & readiness in business. He has a steady hand, writes very fairly, is a very good Accomptant &skilled in all the business of the Mint, & in the Recoynage instructed the Officers and Clerks of the five country Mints, & did other great service. For these reasons the Officers of the Mint (Mr Neale Mr Hall & my self) then recommended him earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury as a fit person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the two late Comptrollers in that time of great business, & when the Comptrollers insisted on Mr Berisford a stranger, Mr Haynes was appointed to take care of the Comptrollers business till Mr Berisford could qualify himself. Since the Recoynage Mr Haynes has been imployed in the Excise Office about two years by Mr Hall above mentioned who is able to give a further character of his abilities & behaviour in both Offices. Yet Mr Neale in  recompence of his services & of his examining & setling the Accompts of the five country Mints continued him his Clerk with a salary of 100li per annum duly paid till his death December 99: which salary being now ceased Mr Haynes has nothing remaining  in lieu of a setled business which as he represents was of more profit & which at the instance of some of the principal Officers of the Mint he quitted to serve the Publick in the Recoynage in hopes of being further considered when there should be an opportunity, so that at present he accounts himself  a loser by that service {and} his Clerk's place  in the Excise Office should be recconed into the bargain.

He is a stranger to me but Exact weighing the credit of the Mint & good dispatch of business  is my interest. To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury.  May it please your Lordships,  Amongst all the Petitioners for the place of Weigher & Teller, whose Petitions are referred to us I have most experience of the abilities of Mr Haynes. The allegations in his Petition are true & while he acted in the Mint he had there a general reputation for integrity, diligence, sobriety, good humour & readiness in business & have been about 14 years amongst us he is skilled in all the business of the Mint & in the time of recoyning the hammered money did great service. In these accounts the Officers of the Mint (Mr Neale, Mr Hall  mentioned in the Petition & my self) then recommended him earnestly to the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury as a very fit person to execute the Office of Comptroller under the two late Comptrollers in that time of great business, & when the Comptrollers insisted on Mr Beresford a stranger, Mr Haynes was appointed to take care of the Comptroller's business till Mr Beresford could qualify himself. After the recoynage of the hammered money was over Mr Haynes was imployed in the Excise Office by Mr Hall above mentioned who is able to give a further character of his abilities & behaviour in both Officers. Yet Mr Neale till his death Decemb. 99 continued him his Clerk with a salary of 100℔ per annum in recompence of his services & examining & {seeking} the Acounts of the five Country Mints. On account of his abilities I have ever since wished for him back into the Mint & if he be not now brought back (as he has been once already at a time when we could not be without him) some person unskilled in our business will instead of him come amongst  us to succeed either in the place of the late weigher & Teller or in the place which his successor shall  leave If any of the Principal Officers or their Clerks or Deputies should at any time die or leave the Mint Mr Haynes is qualified to assist till the place can be supplied anew that the business of the Mint receive no stop. For we want men of skill. If any other Competitor thinks himself equally qualified in Mint affairs I desire that his character may by any friend who best knows it be put into the hands of the Officers of the Mint that we may examin it by tryall & make a true report of his skill to your Lordships. But of the qualifications of such Petitioners as are not versed in  Mint affairs we do not presume to judge.  Herodotus represents Nitocris above mentioned to have been a woman of greater Herodotus tells us that there were two famous Queens of Babylon, Seivanis & Nitocris   & that the latter was  more skilfull. +
 < insertion from lower down f 119v > + She observing that the kingdom of the Medes  having subdued many {enties} & amongst others {Nineve}  was become great & potent, intercepted & fortified the passages out of Media into Babylon, & the river which before was streight she made crooked with great windings  < text from f 119v resumes > 
        The river which was streght before made  crooked  with great windings that it might  be less apt to overflow, & above Babylon dug a Lake Every way 40 miles broad to keep receive the water of the river in spring & keep it for watering the  land.  She built also a bridge over it in Babylon turning the stream into the Lake till the Bridge was built. Philostratus says that she made a {illeg} veta Apollo {illeg} bridge under the River two fathomes broad, meaning an  arched cave over which the river flowed. He calls her  Μηδεια that is a Mede. For Berosus tells us that Nebuchadnezzar built a pensil Garden upon arches because his wife was a Mede & delighted in mountanous prospects, such as abounded in Media but were wanting in Babylon. its probable that he was the sister of Astyages  married Nebuchadnezzar upon a {leage} between their fathers against Nineva  & the many works of Seminarus were extant in  Asia till the days of Syria Next to Mr Haynes I reccon Mr Ford qualified for our business. In integrity & exact weighing I believe them equal & he rates & standards well enough to execute the Office. But if {illeg} {illeg} then the {illeg} {illeg} which  at present  is only exact skill in weighing,  the scales examining  {illeg} & weights,  any of the competitors upon oath steady hands & judicious eyes  may qualify himselfe   by practise in a  fortnight.  May it please your Lordships In obedience to your Lordships order of reference signified to us by Mr Lowndes the 7th instant upon the  annexed Petitions  for the place of Weigher & Teller of the Mint now vacant  we humbly represent that  the Petitioners did the  services mentioned in their  Petitions hereunto annexed, & that for the necessary duty of the place (which  is only exact skill in weighing & in examining the scales & weights) any petitioner who hath steady hands &   is envious may qualify himself   by practise in   a short time 
         But its for the service & advantage of the Mint to have an Officer   further skilled in our business.  And however other Petitioners may be deserving in other respects the most skilfull in  Mint affairs is Mr Haynes. He has served in the Mint about 14 years excepting three or four years intermission & while he acted in the Mint he had there a general reputation  The other Petitioners may  be very deserving  a fit for better business as I could be very glad to oblige them  & their friends but of their qualifications further then I have known any of them by their acting in the Mint I do not presume to judge.    One these accounts he was brought back into the Mint from good business of his own  in the beginning of the late Recoynage when we could not be within him & soon after the Officers of  in the recoynage Mr Brattel  assisted in the Assay Office & was the first Teller who inspected the  old  & told the new money & examined the tale thereof by the weight of the baggs, & the other Petitioners did the services represented in their Petitions To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury  May it please your Lordships  In obedience to your Lordships order of reference signified to Vs by Mr Lowndes the 7th Instant upon the severall annexed Petitions for the place of Weigher and Teller of the Mint now vacant, Wee think it Our Duty first to lay before your Lordships the Nature of the employment t'is a Patent Office with a salary of 90ll a year and 10ll for a Clerk the duty is to weigh in firstly all Gold and silver brought dayly into the Mint to compute the standard value and when tis coyned to pay out to the severall Goldsmiths and Merchants their Iust weight, so that the qualifications for it are not onely great honesty & constant attendance but also skill in rating and standarding, & a readiness, as well as exactness, in handling the weights, upon which Account Wee are humbly of Opinion that such as have not been bred up to some Knowledge of the business of the Mint, can not be so well qualifyied to it, tho' otherwise very deserving persons. Mr. Brattell has liv'd long in the Mint, & assisted his Brother during some part of the recoynage in his Office of Assaymaster for which Mr Neale allowed him a sallary of 100li per Annum. he was alsoe sometimes Employed as first Teller & weigher of the hammered Money with an allowance of 10s a day.

        Petitions true, Mr Haines served in the Mint, dureing the time he was Employed there very well & was two years preferr'd from {there} to the Excise Office, where he is at present. Mr Ford has no other employment but in the Mint, where he now serves very carefully and honestly. As to a further Character of Mr Haines Mr Newton the Master and Worker of the Mint who knows him More particularly is better able to give your Lordshipps an Account To the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of his Majesties Treasury.

But the English will buy much of the French manufactures because of their cheapness & must pay the ballance of trade in money. The case is much the same as that of our trade with India whose manufactures by reason of their cheapness carry away our silver & hinder the consumption of our own manufactures.  We can have no bullion but from the West Indies belonging to Spain & Portugal. The question is whether we shall trade with those nations immediately for bullion, or by the mediation of France.  In the reign of King Cha I, while England furnished the Spaniards in their warrs in Flanders the coinage was very great amounting to about 8 millions In the twelve years between the death of King Cha: I & the return of King Cha: II the cross & Harp money amounted not to more then 800,000li which is less then 70,000li per annum at a medium. Soon after it encreased till in the last 10 years of King Cha: II & King Ia: II it amounted to above 500,000li per annum. Then by the French war it fell to 200,000li per annum in gold at a medium. In the four years between the first & second French wars it amounted to 450,000li per annum at a medium. In the first six years of the 2d French war by the want of the Spanish trade it fell to about 24,000li per annum, & afterwards by the Portugal & Iamaica trade increased so as at present to be about 300,000 per annum, & therefore is as good as ever, & by the addition of the Spanish trade will be better then ever if the French trade do not abate it.  The French manufactures of Linnen & Silk have formerly amounted to above 800,000li per annum, their wines & Brandies to above 200,000li their other commodities to above 100,000li. Where shall we have manufactures & other commodities to ballance this trade, over & above what will be necessary to carry on our trade with Portugal Spain & the West Indies for Bullion.  What need is there of a trade between England & France for manufactures of Silk & woollen. Abate this trade & the rest will not must hurt us."

        to the best of my memory  I represented that if Copper worth 
        1112 per pound weight could be wrought into money by casting, the Copper & Coinage 
         without edging the money would amount unto 1712 per poundweight, & allowing 212d
more for the charge of putting off, buying & setting up coyning tools, repairing the buildings, 
        building furnaces, paying Clerks & a Comptroller, & other incidents, the whole 
        would amount unto 20d per pound weight. And after so much was coyned as was sufficient 
        to supply the defect of what money was wanting at present,  which I recconed 
        might be about 100 Tunns, the surplus above all charges if there were 
        any, might be paid into the Exchequer. And in the next coynage after a copper Mint was set up the money might be made heavier. But by further experience it 
        appeared afterwards that such Copper could not be wrought by casting, but must 
        be  wrought into barrs at the battering Mills. I now beg leave to represent to your Lordship that in my humble opinion the best method of coyning 
        such barrs into money, is to receive the same by weight & assay giving bills to the 
        Importers & taking back the bills upon delivering the same weight of copper 
        in scissel & money together the Importers paying for the coynage of the money by the pound weight a certain seigniorage to be accounted for by the Master & Worker.  That 
        the Importers will expect about 17d per pound weight  above the seigniorage  for their 
        copper & workmanship &  putting off the copper money. And that the Moneyers 
        insist upon 212d for their work & it will cost 12 per pound weight to the Graver & Smith 
        & a Clerk, in all 3d per pound weight to be paid out of the Seigniorage besides the allowance to the Master or his 
        Deputy & such other Officers as shall be appointed & besides the repairs of
        the buildings & charge of the coining tools. All which &c I had almost forgot to observe that Mr Leibnitz himself  set on foot the writing of the papers I have hitherto been answering.  He pretended that he had not  seen the Commerc. 
        nor  was at leisure himself to examin the matter desired  a great Mathematician to do it & sent  his answer dated 7 Iune 1713  to his correspondent to be published in Germany & his correspondent published it with many reflexions, but without any proof.  And in the Remarks its pretended that  Mr Leibnitz had not yet sent his complaint  (that is, the reasons of it) to the Society  not doubting but the Society & Mr Newton himself would entirely disapprove such a proceeding: So that the Society has not been able at all to examin the arguments on both sides & to pronounce a definitive sentence. 10s in 12 year 2gr 40s in 192 years.

May it please your Lordship According to your Lordships verbal Order I humbly lay before your 
        Lordship the state of the Question about the allowance to be made  in the accounts of Mr Allardes for the late coinage of 
        silver moneys  at Edinburgh. By the Indenture of the Mint in the Tower the Master & Worker is allowd sixteen pence half penny upon the pound weight Troy for the coinage of silver moneys. The words of the Indenture are hereunto annexed By her Majesties Warrant of 20 Iune 1707 the Officers of her 
        Majesties Mint at Edinburgh,  were directed to observe the rules of coynage set down in
        the said Indenture with respect to their several offices: but I do 
        not remember that any alteration in the  salaries or in the allowanc{e}
for coinage was then under consideration. The words of the 
        Warrant are hereunto annexed. By an Act of Parliament made in Scotland A.C. 1690 the 
        Master of that Mint  was allowed twenty pounds Scots upon 
        the stone weight Scots for coinage of silver moneys:   & this allowance was accordingly  made till the Vnion. The words of the Act are hereunto annexed.  Three pounds scots are 
        worth 4s 612d english at their just value, but the Scots valued 13 shillings scots at twelve
         pence english before the union & at thirteen pence english in distributing the 
        equivalent. In the first case the allowance comes to almost 1712d
in the second to something more then 1712d, in the third to about 
        19111d, upon the pound weight Troy. The Question is, what shall be allowed in the accounts of  Mr Allardes upon the pound weight Troy for the late coinage of silver moneys.  All which  is most humbly submitted  Is. Newton"

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference upon the Petitions of Iohn Perry & others for making either blanks or plates of fine copper for coining of half pence & farthings We are humbly of opinion that when ever  a new coinage of such money shall be thought fit,2 the same be made of such fine copper as will hammer when red hot, & is worth about 1112  or 12d per pound weight Averdupois unwrought & 3 more when wrought into plates. There is no assay of finer copper to be depended upon. 1 That the  whole coinage be done in the  Mint it being unsafe to have coining tools & coinage abroad. 3 That it be done of coper either  hammered into plates at the Copper mills or cast into barrs in the Mint. In The  last way the money will look as well as in the first without any sensible difference, & in the first it will be 2d in the pound dearer then in the last. But in the   last way there must be two or three ounces of Tinn added to an  weight of copper to make the metal runn close in the casting, whereas  in the first way the money will be of clean copper.  In the latter way a pound weight may be cut into 19 pence in the former into 21 pence. That at present there is no considerable want of copper money. In some places there is too much. In London it is  not much wanted. But if  it be thought fit to set on foot the coinage of copper money by a standing commission after the manner of the coinage of gold & silver, the quantity to be coined from time to time may be left to the discretion of the Lord Treasurer. & About 50 Tunns once in six or seven years may be sufficent. That the stamp for avoiding frequent trouble  to the Queen & Council  & to your Lordship in altering it, remain the same, unless it be thought fit some times upon extraordinary occasions to alter it. That it be edged with such an edging as may be fittest to prevent counterfeiting by casting. That an Importer be appointed to buy & import the copper by weight & receive  back the moneys by weight & tale, & put the same away, & that the Master be carged & discharged by his Note as in the coinage of gold & silver &  be allowed  a Teller to weigh & tell the money  the money to the Importer. In obedience to your Lordships Orders of Reference  upon the Petitions of several persons to succeed Mr Dan. Brattel  in the Officer of Assaymaster to her Majestys Mint in the Tower: We humbly represent that we believe Mr Charles Brattell the said Daniel to be well qualified for that Place &  him the fittest person among the Petitioners  to succeed therein  All which  In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference upon the Petition    of Iohn Pery & others for supplying the Mint with either blanks or plates of fine copper to be coined into half pence or farthings,  I humbly represent that whenever there shall be a coinage of copper money whether it be by  Patent or upon account, the whole coinage including the making of the blanks be done in the Mint it being unsafe to have coining tools  & coinage abroad. And that the Petitioners & others who have copper works be treated with, & his copper chosen which is best coloured & most malleable & cheapest of those sorts of copper which will hammer when red hot. Such copper is worth about 11 or 12d the pound, & There is no certain test of finer copper. And the great price of the finest copper will tempt people to counterfeit the money made thereof. The copper may be either  hammered into plates at the  copper mills or cast into barrs in the Mint by the addition of 2 or 3 ounces of Tin to an hundred weight of copper in fusion to make the metal  run close. The latter way is cheaper by 2d in the pound weight & the less the extrinsic value of the money is the less apt it will be to be counterfeited. In obedience to your Lordships Order of Regerence upon the Petitions of Iohn Pery & others for making either blancks of plates of fine coper for coining half pence or farthings We humbly represent That copper money is at present very little wanted, but if it shall be thought fit to put the coinage of such money into a standing method, We are humbly of opinion 
         
        1 That the whole coinage, including the blanks, be done in the Mint, it being unsafe to have coining tools  & coinage abroad. 2 That it be done of the cheapest fine copper which will hammer when red hot & is worth about 11d or 12d per pound weight. In finer & dearer copper we may be deceived, there being no certain test of its degrees of fineness, & the great price will tempt fals coiners to counterfeit it 3 That it be done  out of copper either hammered into plates at the copper mills, or cast into  barrs or fillets at the Mint with an addition of two or three ounces of Tin to an hundred weight of copper in fusion to make the metal runn close. The last way is cheapest by 2d in the pound weight & therefore  to be preferred. For there will be least got by counterfeiting that money whose workmanship is cheapest. 4 That the stamp for avoiding frequent trouble to the Queen & Council in altering it, remain one & the same unless it shall be thought fit at any time upon any extraordinary occasion to alter it. 5 That  this money be edged with such an edging as may be fittest to prevent counterfeiting by casting. 6 That  an Importer be appointed to buy & import the copper by weight & receive it back by weight & tale & put the same away, & that he be paid by the weight of the copper  for his pains & charges. 7 That the Master & Worker for the time being be charged & discharged by his Note as in the coinage of Gold & Silver & be allowed a Teller for  weighing  & telling the money  between hiom & the Importer & entring all receipts & payments, & that if the copper imported  prove not good upon the Assay the Master have power to refuse it.

        P. to have been in the Nation about the year 1676 I made severall 
        abatements in my former paper, as 1st of a Million or a million & a half of counterfeit 
        Money Mr P. (sect 8) thinks this abatement too much by far & that the 
        Counterfeit Money scarce exceeded 100000li. I reccon  thus. The 
        five Millions melted down in the Exchequer proved one Ingot with another about 7dwt
worse then standard. This worsness arose from false silver money 
        of base allay and if in the pieces of base allay taken one with 
        another one half of the mettal was fine silver the  money of base allay must 
        have been about the 15 part of the 5 Millions, that is about the third 
        part of a Million. There was another sort of false money made of sterling silver in imitation of  little clipt money. They made it  of clippings and broad money without allay and this being of standard silver, past as Current as if it had been Coyned in the Kings Mint 
        & for that reason abounded most in the Coyn. I reccon it therefore at above 
        12 a million The Brass money being most discernable was least in 
        Quantity. If it be recconed 112 per Cent of the whole, it will amount 
        to about 75000li so that all the Counterfeit money in these five Millions 
        amounted to about 900000li And if all the Counterfeit Money in the 
        other five Millions Recoyned was but one third part as much, the
        whole will amount to  1200000li. 2dly I abated 500000li for the wearing of the money & 3dly
3 or 400000li for the clipping thereof and the abatements were 
        proportional to what I had observed in some parcels of broad 
        hammered money which had been long hoarded in the Country most
        of it unclipt & the rest not so much clipt but about 25 or 30 years ago it 
        might be very possible in payments the clipping scarce appearing 
        to the Eye without weighing the pieces.  Mr P. makes the like abatements  in my Computation 
        for the wearing culling washing & filing of the Milled money. But this could not amount 
        to 12 per Cent & in all the  milled money (new & old together & so is considerable, whereas the wear of the hammered money was about 5 per cent, & clipping almost as much. 4thly out of the milled money which in 1676 he reccons at 3 millions 
        I abated above a Million. For  the Kings Warrant for Coyning Milled money of Gold & silver, with four distinct Escutcheons on the Reverse was dated in April 1663 & from that time to the end of 
        December 1676 there was coyned in silver by the Mint accompts 
        1779277li 19s. 6d. whereof about 220000li was out of Cross and 
        Harp Money or  the money for Dunkirk
        In stead of 3 Millions therefore he should have recconed only 1779277li. 19s. 6d, so that I had reason to about above a million out of his recconing 5thly out of the 3 Millions recconed to be melted 
        down out of that hammered money after  the years 1676, I make 
        another great abatement of two Millions and an half. Mr P. (sect. 7) replies that his assertion as to those 3 Millions was grounded upon informations taken from men that were Apprentices or Servants to Goldsmiths and Refiners they owning that after the year 1670 they found above 13 of the old Coyn fitter for their purpose then the new milled money I answer that they that culled for Melting culled also for clipping the clippings being as fit for Melting as the weighty money and that they might frequently find a third part of the hammered Money fit for both these purposes together and more fit then the Milled money was, that being unfit for the Clippers Trade. But if the men above mentioned affirmed that after the year 1676  they found one third part of the hammered money weightier then the Milled Money was & on that account fitter to be culled for melting, there seems to be some mistake in the testimony. For the hammered shillings had one with another lost above 5 graines apiece by wearing as I found by weighing some parcells of unclipt shillings. These were therefore grown too light to be so fit for the cullers Trade as that Milled Money generally was and the Sixpences were more worn in proportion to their weight and that smaller Money still more. All the Money of Queen Eliz and almost all that of King Iames the I and half that of King Cha. I was in shillings and sixpences and smaller money and so not fit for Culling to the Melting Pott The half Crowns were scarce a third part of all the hammered Money and therefore in the year 1676 scarce Exceeded 4 Millions. Of these 4 Millions part were hoarded in the Country and since the year 1676  Came not to the cullers hands, part were clipt either before 1676 or afterwards and part were culled for Melting before the year 1676, and the rest had one with another lost 7 or 8 grains a piece by wearing so that scarce one in tenn was so weighty as the milled half Crowns but if we should allow one in five to have been so weighty yet they would scarce amount to half a Million. I do not see therefore but that the abatements which I {made}
out of M{r} P's recconing of 16 Millions were reasonable, so 
        
         <622r> 
        
        that instead of supposing that about the year 1676 we had 
        16 millions of silver monies I had rather reccon that we have not then above 10 or 11 Millions and that in the year 1689 
        when we were richest we had but about 1234 Millions of 
        those monies not in tale but in weight and fineness. In my Recconing how much silver money 
        remains now in the Nation  I said that we have 
        about a Million of old milled money or not much less Mr
P. (sect 9) thinks that we have not half so much. His reasons are 
        the great Consumption there was of that Coyn after 76 & the 
        small appearance of it in the time of the Recoynage or since. 
        My recconing was grounded upon the appearance of this money which I did met with in payments. For by examining the 
            Proportion of the old milled money to the new in a parcell or 
        two,  I had found the old about an eight or ninth part of the 
        whole. And since the writing of my former paper I examined 
        the proportion againe in a Parcell of 25li of silver monies 
        brought to me from the Bank of England & I found in it 3li
1s. 6d of old milled money which is about an 8th part of the whole. And in another parcel I found it above a sixt part of the whole. Now if we reccon (in round numbers) thatt there were about seven millions recoyned & that the old milled money mixed therewith is an sighth part of the whole then that old milled  money at its first mixing with the new must have been about a million
                Mr. P sect {9}) says that if we have so much old milled money 
        it ought to be added to the Computation of the 16 millions. I 
        answer that in the computation of the 16 millions Mr P. in his first paper recconed 
        3 Millions of old milled money, which (as I have shewed) was too much by above a 
        Million, & therefore ought not now to be encreased. What is said by Mr P. (sect 10) to diminish my accompt of the 
        Guinea has been considered above where I shewed that there has been not onely a large Coynage but also a large increase of our stock. In my former paper I made an abatement of an eight
        
         <622r> 
{part} of the whole for the weighty Guineas culler out and brought back 
        to the mint and if that abatement should be doubled it would 
        not very much diminish my recconing, Especially if the Guineas 
        coyned the last  year which in my former paper I did not reccon and the forreign gold monies which of 
        late by the overballance of trade have plentifully flowed into England 
        and still continued to do so, be added to it. And after the culling and 
        recoyning of the weighty Guineas has been allowed for it  ought 
        to be objected no more, unless it cane be proved that the allowance 
        is too little. If any Gold hath been bought with the clippings of silver monies melted down into Ingotts & Exported as Mr P. (sec {9}) thinks probable: the Gold is an addition to our stock of Guineas and the silver exported is allowed for in my former paper in the 512 millions lost out of the silver monies And the like is to be said of gold brought in by Forreigners to get by loads upon Publick funds   &c for since the year 1694 we have paid our Forreigne debts in any thing rather then gold And those debts which now remaine unpaid are not to be considered in recconing the Quantity of moneys now in the Nation but are to be accounted for in the Course of Exchange & ballance of trade which at present is on our side, & yet must be deducted from our wealth & may entitle forreigner to some part of our money. All which being considered I do not see but that the 
        recconings set down in my former paper come near the truth 
        vizt that in the year 1689 when we were richest we had about 
        1234 millions in silver monies (not in tale but standard value) and 
        about 514 millions in Guineas & Pistoles, in all about 18 Millions 
        besides broad Gold. And at present we have about 714 millions in 
        Silver monies milled and hammered and about 812 Millions in 
        Guineas & Pistoles besides broad Gold in all we have about 1534
millions which is about 214 Millions less then in the year 1689 & a considerable quantity of which my belong to forreigners by reason of their stocks in our publick funds. In makeing this 
        Estimate I do not pretend to be exact. Where I could meet with exact 
        recconings I followed them and in the rest I used the best of my judgment"

This summ, after the rate of 11034 pounds Averdupois to the Dutch weight, & 10 Gilders 12 Stivers to 20s sterling, comes to 42 Gilders per 100 Dutch weight. By the Rule of false Position let the price in selling be put 45 Gilders per 100 Dutch weight & the charges of selling will be as follows. Further Considerations. 1. The Pewterers in London factor upon trust for their correspondents in Holland & some other places, in small parcels of 10 20 30 or 40 blocks in a parcel & find it not very difficult matter to meet with ships which want convenient ballast, & the people for whom they factor commonly act for themselves in their houses shops & ware houses without the charges of Commission & Brokerage; & making three or four returns in a year content themselves with a small profit of one or two per cent in each return, & chuse rather to risque it then be at the charges of Ensuring. And the Pewterers sorting the Tin, make a profit of the grain Tynn into Holland, not finding their account in selling it there by commission. 2. By the above written Account it should be almost equall to a Merchant of Amsterdam to give 3li 16s per  Averdupois at London, or 43 Gilders 18 stivers per 100 Dutch weight at Amsterdam;  paying in ready money & her Majesty bearing the extraordinary charges of her Office & Warehouse room at Amsterdam, & of the city weigh-house. I say almost equal, because the Merchant would desire to save the freight & chuse to risque it, especially in times of peace.  < insertion from f 499r > 2. By the above written Account the Merchant can have Tynn housed at Amsterdam for 43G 11st34 besides 212st charges of returning the money. And this puts the price at 44 Gilders 014 stivers in ready money. Add for prompt payment, ensurance of payments & two months interest, 1 Gilder 4st. & the price at Amsterdam will be 45G 434st. But the merchant would chuse rather to buy at London then pay Freight & Averidge, & to risque it at sea then allow 1 per cent insurnace, especially in times of peace. < text from f 498v resumes >   < insertion from f 499r > 3 Considerable quantities of Tynn are sent hence to Roterdam & Bruges, & unless something be allowed for the charges of getting it thither from Amsterdam, they will still have it from London. < text from f 498v resumes >  5 When Mr Drummond first proposed to sell Tynn by Commission for her Majesty, he represented that the price had then been from 45 to 47 Gilders. The late Lord Treasurer put the price at 4412 & Mr Drummond by that price had the whole trade of Holland. Might he not at 45 have had almost the whole trade & at 46 half the trade, & at 47 have sold some of the best Tin?    To ensure hazzards at sea & in returning the payments would carry away too much of the profit of the traders. The Pewterers make an advantage by culling out the grain Tin. They usually save the freight by finding ships that want ballast{.} What they reccon to their correspondent for factoring I cannot yet learn not  what methods they have of getting the price of Tin returned & at what charge. But if all these things taken together be recconed at about a Gilder, the whole charge of housing Tin at Amsterdam will amount to about 45 Gilders. Octob. 1712.  Proxime Is. Newton"

        of gold were made afterwards  for the House of Commons then sitting & delivered to their Speaker, & forty more  of gold
        were delivered to my Lord Chamberlain, for forreign Ministers. A pound weight 
        of  fine Gold was cut into 20 Medals & a pound weight 
        of fine silver into 22 Medalls. But the forreign Ministers (except the Agents & Consuls) had Medals of double the value. At the Coronation of King Wm there were only 200 medals of ☉ made by Order of Council. After the form of the Medalls & of his Majestys Effigies is setled, it will take up about a Calendar month 
            to make the Puncheons & three or four days more to 
            make the Dyes & coyne the Medalls by the Mill & Press{.}
And if either of the Puncheons should break as it sometimes happens it would take up a fortnight more to repair the loss. 
            The Coynage 
            Duty being appropriated, there should be money  advanced  
              out of the civil List  for buying ☉ & ☽. If the Impression is to rise high like that of the  
    Medalls made upon the late peace, the medalls must be coyned in a 
    ring, & to Make the Puncheons & Dyes & coyne 15 hundred  medalls of this sort will take up six weeks  & if either of the puncheons should break it would take up two months. And the medalls much be weightier  that there may be substance to make the Impression rise high. Sixteen Medalls of this sort  will require a pound weight of fine gold, & twenty a pound weight of fine silver."

All which, and every one, and many more of these Particulars and Circumstances, will easily be proved and attested: Also how their Agents had employ'd at the Business of the Hogue, a hundred thousand Pounds against the Government, since the happy Revolution. Now, Sir, in Length and Process of Time, these things will be worn out of Memory and forgot, or else the Witnesses die, and then they will boldly affirm, it was a meer Fiction, or a downright Lie, and Maugre all your Designs, will possess their Lands and Revenues in England, that when Opportunity offers, will like nourished Vipers sting you to Death. I shall not enumerate the many Dangers whereunto we are daily exposed by this sort of People; for certainly you are not Ignorant of their hellish Intriegues: I do, with Submission, take it to be an undeniable Maxim, That if England was once so happy, as to be Purged of those Locusts, who debauch the Youth by their erronious Doctrine, and worse Practises; and in carrying Youth over to the Seminaries and Monastries beyond the Seas; teach them, that in Murthering a Heritick, they thereby do God and their Church good Service, and so send them home fraught with dangerous and diabolical Principles. I presume, if these Mischiefs were once removed, we should for the future live in Concord, and promote the Welfare of the established Church and Nation. Wherefore it concerns you highly at this Instant, to lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree, and so at once exterpate Popery out of this Realm; I mean, not by sanguinary Laws now Massacres, which those Blood-thirsty Men have, and do daily inflict upon our poor distressed Brethren, but only by a Re-inforcement of those ancient Laws which hitherto have prov'd defective, and some ew additional one, viz. That those Rents and Revenues which they hold, and have fraudulently obtained to pray Souls out of Purgatory, &c. may be Converted to the Government, or some Hospital for maimed Soldiers, or Augmentation to small Livings; and as it comes from Impious, so it may be Converted to Charitable and Pious Uses.   And I hope that every Member of your August Assembly, will think it highly necessary to promote so good and Religious a Work. These Things being duly weighed and considered, I doubt not but in a very short time the House will be sensible of the great Service and Safety will thereby accrew to her Majesty's Royal Person and Government:  And also the black Designs of our intestine Enemies will be frustrated, and the Glory of the present Queen be transmitted to Posterity, and even surmount that of Queen Elizabeth."

Which being recconed at half a million or  a million  there will remain a million & 12 or 2 millions or 212 of the old milled money  wasted during the French war  & in the same time there might be perhaps half a million of the  weightiest old hammered money culled out & exportedbesides what was run into counterfeit moneys. For this old money being part of it clipt or culled out {for melting} before that war & all of it grown lighter since the coynage by wearing afforded the last 10 years a much  less quantity of heavy money fit to be culled out for melting or exportation then the milld money did. Now All these recconnings put together make about  give millions wasted during the war part of which has been turned into Gold plate & counterfeit money & so it not lost to us. From these five millions subduct {t}he gain of 312 millions of gold & there will remain about a million & a half of our treasure of ☉ & ☾ wasted  in the first six years of the war which is after the rate of 250000li per an. And if we reccon the same wast to have continued  to the end of the war & since to this present time by the two east India companies striving to refurnish the nation with Indian commodities & breake one another  (for  the demand of bullion for exportation has been greater since the war then in it)  the whole wast of our  ☉ & ☾ treasure (including plate & the old hammered money which still continues to flow out of the country to London & is part of it exported) will in the last 10 or 11 years  amount to 212  or perhaps 3 millions. In these recconings I differ in somethings from Mr P. {H}e considers only the quantity  of silver monies I reccon our wealth in gold & silver money & plate together. He reccons (according to one of the papers above mentioned) that our coynage has decreased ever since the currency of {N}otes  1660, I that it increased exceedingly till the first year of the present reign 1689 & decreased only since the present late French war, He that we had 10 millions of hammered money before 1663  because so much was lately recoined I deduct above a million & an half for  counterfeit money & weare. He adds three millions more of the weightiest hammerd money melted  down, which I take to be less then a million & omitts the hammered money which since the recoinage has flowed & still flows out of the country to London &  has most of it been run into plate & may be accounted above half a million. And from these accounts he reccons that   before the year 1675 when then  clipping trade began to increase there was 13 millions of broad hammered money besides three millions of milled money in all 16 millions which recconning seems to me too bigg by  3 or 4 millions. Guineas culled out & sent back to the mint be recconed about 18 of the whole  there will remain about six millions, one million of which may be supposed at that time to be current abroad in Holland & other neighbouring parts of Europe. The  remaining 5 millions added to the 1212 millions of silver moneys makes the whole cast of England at the beginning of the French war where we were richest to be 1712 millions in intrinsic value, besides broad Gold coyned before the death of Cha. I. From Dec 31 1689 to Dec 31 1699 there has bin coyned in gold 2059384. 6. 7 If an eighth part thereof be subducted  as weighty guineas culled cut & sent back to the Mint & to the remainder be added the French & Spanish Pistols & the Guineas abroad which returned hither when Guineas were at 30s each & afterwards at 22s  & all which (considering that above a million has been coyned here out of forreign gold monies & that Pistols are here at a highest value then Guineas) Ile reccon at about a Million & an half or above, the whole increase of our ☉ after since Dec 31 1689  will be about 313 millions. And this added to the 5 millions in Guineas recconed before will make about 813 millions in Guineas in England at present. And this added to the 623 millions of silver makes 15 millions of Gold & silver milled monies now in England. Which deducted fr{om} the 1712 millions which we had in 1689 leaves a  loss of 212 millions of ☉ & ☾  together, made since that year  by means of the war with France.  so then your money  decreased by this war in the proportion of 6 to 7 or thereabouts, & we lost but a seventh part of the whole. One quarter of this decrease of our money was made in  the beginning of the war by our paying the Dutch   their charges of the Kings expedition hither, to rescue us from Popery & slavery — — & the rest  by our buying naval stores of the Northern Cro{wns} by our maintaining armies in Ireland & Flanders, by the losses of our merchants   at sea & decay of Trade & of late by the  the two east India companies contending to replenish the nation with Indian commodities & to break one another. All which were  the effect of the French war.  And our Luxury occasioned by our great riches both in money & credit before the war began to affectus, may come in for another cause there being no nation  fonder then we of  then we of far fetcht Trinkets & all manner of expensive guildery for Bows & Ladies. For though our riches are abated yet our Luxury remains. And if this could be duly checkt the danger from paper credit would cease  while the advantage of it remains for promoting Trade & business. The loss we have susteined in our Coyn by the French war has bin only of silver. We have lost six millions of ☾ & gained 312 of gold. And this inequality must have some other  cause then Paper credit. In the 18 years before the enacting of the Coynage Duty there was coyned in ☉ 259359li. 3. 0 in Gold & 969559. 9. 5 in ☾ so that the silver coyned was above triple  in value to the gold.  In the 1st 9 years of that Act  there was coyned in Gold monies 1154487. 8. 10 (recconing a guinea at 21s 6d). & in silver monies 1105103. 4. 4 which is very nearly an equality In the next nine years there was coyned in gold monies 3055473. 5. 8 & in silver money 1647517li. 8s. 8d which is  almost two to one of gold In the next five years there was coyned in gold monies 2414239li. 4s. 5d. & in silver 578021li. 2s. 6, which is above four to one of gold. And this last 10 years there has been coyned  little or no forreign silver & above two millions of Gold, Besides the Guineas & Pistoles which came from abroad. If This decrease of the coynage of ☾ & running our cash into ☉ be recconed the effect of paper credit or of Luxury or the late French war, the cause of the distemper is mistaken Mr Lowndes reccons that in the reigns of Q. Eliz, K Iames & K. Charl{es} I there was coyned 15110 millions of silver monies: whereof all the crowns & all the money smaller then sixpences  are long since gone & also all the 12 Crowns of Queen Eliz. And no doubt many of the shillings & sixpences of Q Eliz & 12 Crowns shillings & 6p of K Iames & K Cha were also lost before the recoynage of the money. This loss Mr Lowndes{in} computes at about 10 millions but by subducting the 935 millions which remained at the recoinage it appears to be but about 525 millions. It happened1 by the wearing away & losing of  the small money, 3 by  melting down the largest & weightiest pieces for goldsmiths uses or to be recoyned or of later years to be exported by the  East India company. &  principally2 by seamen merchants & Travellers carrying  pocket money along with them in their voyages & spending it abroad, by burying summs of money or accidentally lsoing many pieces & in these last 10 years by exporting some of it for defraying such charges as the French war  occasioned. Let us suppose that of these 525 millions, three fourth parts were lost before the war & one fourth part or about 113 million in the first 7  years of the war & this 113 million added to the 814 & 913 millions will make about 9912 millions of sterling silver I exercise & counterfeit   in all the hammered monies  genuine & counterfeit    remaining in the nation in the year 1689 according to the  intrinsic value thereof & about 1023 millions in the tale of all the genuine part of those hammered silver monies. Untill the end of the year 1689 silver bullion came to the mint in good plenty & the whole coynage of milled silver money amounted to  360051l. 18s. 00d of which if we suppose about a fift  part to have been then wasted partly by  seamen merchants & travellers  carrying pocket money beyond sea & partly by culling out the weightiest pieces for the use of Goldsmiths or to be recoynd or exported to India  (for this weighty money was much fitter for the cutters use then the worn hammered money) there will remain about three millions which with the 9712 millions of hammered money makes about 1212 millions of silver money  (good & bad) not in tale but according to the standard weight & intrinsick value thereof in or near the end of the year 1689 when I reccon we had most silver money in the nation. But  in the late recoynage there has bin 6900000li of  milled money made out of  hammered money & plate to {ne}plate & by the proportion of the old milled money to the ne{w} at pre{illeg}est in  ordinary payment (which I have not must observed, but lately found  an in a certain parcel an eighth part of the whole )  if the old be recconed at 7 or 800000li  &  the wast of all the milled money by exportation since the year 1696 at as much or perhaps at  a million there will  remain now in the nation about 623 millions of silver money, besides plate which  is as much  increased since the recoynag{e} as decreased by it. Deduct this 623 millions from the 1212 millions  & the whole loss of silver monies since the year 1689 will remain about six millions.  But all this was not lost to the nation, some part of it was turned into Gold. The Guineas coyned till Dec 31 1689 amounted to 5843056. 11. 9 reccon a Guinea at 21s 6d. If  the weight{y}
 Mr P. reccons that there were  10 millions of hammered money recoyned which was good  broad money befpre  the clipping trade began.  & that 3 million more have bin melted down  since the year 1676.  To which he adds 3 millions of milled money coyned before that year & so reccons that we had then 16 millions of good silver coyn of which scarce 6 millions remain now in the nation so that  since the year 1676 we have lost 10 millions./ But in this account the loss should be dated rather from the year 1689 then from the year 1676 & there should be an  abatement of the counterfeit money which was part of the 10 millions recoyned & may amount to a million or a million & an half. There should also be an abatement for the wear of the money which by weighing some parcels of  hammered unclipt money I reccon might amount to about {6}0000li. And after a good part of a the weightiest hammered money have been culled out to be sent back to the Mint or for the Goldsmiths or Merchants use,  & the remainder lightned by long wearing & some of it by clipping . to reccon a third or 4th part of the whole still fit for the cullers purpose seems to me too much./In  one of the above mentioned Accounts written in November 1675 I find a great complaint against the East India Company for exporting great quantities of gold & silver whereby the price of standard silver was then inhansed from under 5s the ounce to 5s & 4d, which occasioned all the weighty coyn to be culled out & melted into Bullion. And after this complaint it probable that there remained not above the 6th or 8th part of the  hammered    money so weighty & fit for the culler as all the milled money was. // Let us therefore out of the millions recoyned subduct 14 million so that instead of 3 millions of weighty hammered money melted  down since the year 1678 I would not reccon above a million or at most a million & an half of counterfeit money partly standard & partly of coarse allay & add about 5 or 600000li more of  broad hammered money which has flowed out of the country to London & been  used by the Goldsmiths ever since the recoinage & the whole tale of hte genuine hammered money at the time of the recoinage & will be about 935 or  millions whereof  about 834 millions (the excess of the 10 millions above the counterfeit money) was recoyned & together with the  counterfeit money intermixed made about 635 millions of milled money, so that  there was  lost  about 2320 million of silver by  wearing & clipping. /Of this I reccon about 12 a million lost by wearing & by consequenceabout 123 millions lost by clipping, & running the clippings either into plate or milled money or Ingots for  exportation. Let us suppose one third part of this to be lost before the  French war began to affect us A.C. 1689 & there will remain 119 million lost in {the ensuing  7 years of that war untill the 1st year of the recoynage} which added to the 635 millions will make 73245 millions of  sterling silver conteined in the 834 millions of money/ in the begining of that war A.C. 1689, besides the 5 or 600000li of weighty hammered money which has since flowed  out of the Country which  makes the whole  money about 913 millions in tale & 814 millions in value   in the year 1689 when  we entered into that war. Before the enacting of the coynage Duty the Master & Worker of his Majestys  {} It proceeds from the cheapness of Gold in China & Iapan,   gold being there almost twice as cheap as with us so that our Merchants  make a considerable advantage by purchasing  Iapan gold of the Dutch & of late a greater (above 50 per cent) by purchasing  China gold of the natives. Now if this be the case then tis our interest not to keep our silver {bor} to send  to China & to encourage the trade with China much more then that with India, for China is inclined to take off our manufactures which India is not & the   trade for their gold which is now Commenc{in{g}} must greatly increases our coyn being as profitable to the nation  as to the merchant himself.  And tho it should  decrease our silver yet if it leave us but silver enough tor  markets & workmens wages the Gold will serve for all other uses. This trade by  creating plenty of Gold & want of silver it may  lower the price of gold which when all our wealth consists in gold would be to our dammage. But if we may  first get more wealth in gold by the trade then we shall afterwards losse  by the fall of its price  I see not why we should leave the trade with this advantage to any other nation.  Its better that wee should  drain  our neighbouring of their silver by supplying them with Indian & China commodities & then turn their silver into ☉ at 60 per cent profit then that  any other nation should sell us Indian commodities & buy ☉ with our ☾.] Tis certain that before the late French war our coyne encreased very much by our Trade  & this increase grew greater & greater till the war put a check to it, & therefore now the war is over I see not why our trade in a little ti{me} may not become as profitable as before especially now our disadvantageous trade with France is checkt & that also with India for wrought silks & staind Callicos &  & there is such a duty upon  other Indian perishable commodities as  may begin to make it as profitable to bring  home  the gold we purchase in China as to lay it all out in India supposing the trade of running goods to {tr}{w}ade the Kings customes can be stopt.  It is to be considered also that, paper credit is upon a much better foundation in the Bank of England then formerly in Goldsmiths hands who took greater interest & frequently broke, both which are prejudicial to trade,  & the old east India company who have done us most mischief may after another year trade for no more then 325000li per an & must export in English manufactures 100000li per an.  And    there is some prospect of setting   foot a trade to New Engl. for naval stores And if to these advantages   general laws were added a general law (with such temporary exceptions as might be requisite to make the law pass more easily) that no manufacture shall be imported hither from any nation which does not take off as much in value of manufacture from hence, it would  much enrich us I speak of manufacture only, not of commodities of native growth. 
    
     <626v> 
        
         Whilst the trade for commodities of the native growth of all countries remains free, no ship should import more manufacture from abroad then it carried  hence into the country where it took its lading. And tho we lost between 2 & 3 millions by the war yet this loss is so well made up by the Credit of the Bank of England & some other new credit that Interest  is fallen to 5 per cent as it was before the war And if We have recconed our losses in silver alone to be much greater then in ☉ & ☾ together,  the gold encreasing while the silver was exported. And this certainly proceeded from some other cause then paper credit. so that instead of gaining 5 or 6 hundred thousand pounds per annum as we did before the war we lost between 2 & 3 hundred thousand pounds during the war Which loss accrued to us by the {ch} {of} decay of trade & the losses & charges abroad during the war, & since by the  contention between the 2 East India companies contending to replenish the nation with Indian commodities & break one another. But as for paper credit that was so far from hurting us that we suffered most by the war when we most wanted it./ that the want of it during the recoynage brought us into the greatest difficulties. It was then found by experience that the want of it made  the Interest of money very high which was very chargeable to the government & put a great damp upon trade & as this credit recovered Interest fell & trade revived. And if Interest be not yet low enough for the advantage of trade, & Arts (as understanding men think it is not) the only proper way to lower it is more paper credit till by trading we can get more money. To lower it by Act of Parliament is a violent method,  & force is apt to put trade & business out of humour. The law should rather follow & comply with the free & voluntary course of interest then attempt to force it.  Let it be considered therefore what Interest is best for the nation & let there be so much credit & no more as brings money down to that Interest. For this is the due proportion of credit for making the nation flourish. Had we lost 10 millions since we were richest (as Mr P. reccons there would now need to {be} millions of new credit to supply that loss so as to bring down Interest to the former rate which was about 5 per cent: whereas we find it now brought down to that Interest without  the addition of 2 or 3 millions of credit more then we had before the war which is an argument that our whole loss of gold & silver monies doth not  exceed  two or three millions. The Master & Worker of his Majestys Mint coyns every pound weight of standard silver into 62 shillings & before the enacting of the Coynage Duty paid 60 shillings to the Importer & two shillings to the King, and if by the triall of the Pix it appeared that he had coyned it into more or less then 62 shillings (for it was impracticable to be exact) the excess of defect was entred of record & the Master accounted with the King for the same  being bound to do so by a clause in the Indenture of the Mint. And since the making of the coynage Act the Master is bound by that Act to pay to the Importer the whole pound weight in new monies whether it make more or less then 62 shillings coyns the money by the same assay by which he receives it so that he can neither get nor lose by the excess or Defect, & yet the said clause remains still in the Indenture. Quære. Whether may the King by virtue of the said clause in the Indenture demand of the Master  a recconing for the said excess & defect, & in order thereunto require the Officers of the Mint to enter the same of record? And this loss is made up by the new Credit of the Bank & Exchequ{e}r so as to bring down interest to 5 per cent as it was before the French war: For this {new} credit amounts  only to  & so answers well to that loss but is much too little to make up a loss of ten millions  so as to bring down interest to the same rate of 5 per cent. The Lordship of Twyford  is in the Parish of Colsterworth  & accordingly hath time out of mind paid to Coulsterworth all Assessments to Church & poor & for the High ways   &  by a statute of the 14th of Char II ch 6 & 3 & 4 W & M ch 12 all lands liable to Church & Poor ought to pay to the Constables Assessments (vide the statute). Coulsterworth is in the soak of Grantham & Twyford is not in the soak of Grantham {ou}t in the  hundred of Beltisloe & therefore  the Constable of the neighbouring town of Northwitham which is also in the hundred of Beltisloe, hath  collected the Kings Taxes at Twyford & been allowed by the Constable of Coulsterworth the sessions charges   And now because the Constable of Witham collects the Kings Taxes at Twyford the Iustices at their Quarter Sessions held  for the parts of Kesteven in the County of Lincoln Ian 8 1699 have ordered that Twyford shall  thence forward pay (not Assessments to the Church & Poor & Highways, but only) Constables Levies to Northwitham. Q. 1. Whether  notwithstanding that Order Parish Assessments to be raised by the said statutes ought not to be paid to Coulsterworth, the several statutes in such cases limiting them to be raised by the Churchwardens & Constables of the Parish 2. If  the Constable & town of Witham  levy an Assessment upon Twyford & distrein  what will be the properest way to try the matter at Common law? by Replevin, or action for taking & deteining  the goods quousque &c 3 Whether may not the Constable of Coulsterworth make a Deputy at Twyford & by   his Deputy if notby himself act in Beltisloe hundred  without giving the Constable of Northwitham any further trouble. 3 Whether is not the Constable of Coulsterworth constable of the whole parish including Twyford, with power to act inBeltisloeHundred either by himself or a Deputy  without giving the Constable of Witham any further trouble. –above a million since the year 1688  & if upon all the above mentioned accounts an abatement be made {o}ut of the 16 millions be made there will remain but about 12 millions   To which if we add about 12 a million  of old hammered money which has since the recoynage been flowing out of the country & wasted by the Goldsmiths or exported the whole will be about {1}212 millions of silver monies in intrinsic value in the year 1689 when we were richest. :And in the  year 1688 I reccon that we had about 712 millions of milled money old & new together which being deducted leave a loss of about 5 millions, besides what has been exported since by the East India Companies which  I reccon less then a million & if it should amount to a million would make the whole loss in our silver monies but about six millions during the late Franch war & since. But all this was not lost to the nation. And if we may reccon one half  of this to have been afterwards clipt & the other half melted down & exported without clipping & that there was as much or more exported between the years 1676 &1689 as  in the 8  following years untill the hammered money ceased to go by tale. the weighty hammered money melted down & exported without clipping in those 8 years will  scarce exceed half a million  Recconing therefore this half million instead of the three millions  and that in the year 1689 there were about 313 millions of milled mon{i}es  & making the other abatements above mentioned  we shall have instead of the 16 millions in the year 1676 something less then 12 millions in the year 1689 when we were richest to which if we add the old hammered money which remained in the country & in Ireland in the end of the recoynage &  which I'le reccon at a million, the whole will be almost 13 or about 1234 millionsof silver monies,  not in tale but in  weight & fineness.  The new milled silve monies made in the recoynage & since is about 6900000ll & the old 
        
        {}aboutalmost 
       
       a million as I gather by the proportion of the old to the new in a  parcells or two.  To which add the million of hammered money supposed to remain in the country & in Ireland & in the whole will amount to about 834 millions.  Of which if I may reccon about a millions & an half to have been melted down   partly for  goldsmiths uses & partly for exportation during the recoynage & since there will  remain about 714 millions of silver money illed & hammered still in the nation. Which deducted from the 1234 millions leaves a loss of about 512 millions made during the late French war & since, which one year with another amounts to about half a million per an. yeares was more in the 20 years following & in each of the four periods of 20 years the coynage  varied so very much  according various causes that it seems  to : have depended more upon those other causes then upon the rise & growth of paper credit. 18, 19. And if both ☉ & ☾ e taken together the whole coynage since the currency of Notes 1660 (as appears by the Mint book.) has been above twelve millions , which I take to be a much greater addition to our stock than what was taken from it by culling clipping & melting down:   But in examining by such accounts of the coynage as have been heretofore given in by command of the house of commons, or now remain in the Mint,  whether   this credit has been of more advantage to England by increasing its trade or disadvantage by increasing it{s} luxury  I do not find  that it has hitherto  done us any great hurt. Here he  sets down only the coynage of silver  whereas that of ☉ ought also to be examined & in the first 20 years he tells us that 400000 per an was coyned in silver alone where as this summ was the whole coynage of both gold & silver together. And the coynage of the last 60 years he distinguishes into 3 periods of 20 years each  which have no relation to the main causes of the incre{ase} & decrease thereof. For the coynage was very great in the reign of K. Cha. 1. & the main causes & periods of the increase & decrease of the coynage he considers not. Vpon perusing Mr Polixfin's paper designed to have informed myself about the  several quantities of ☉ & ☾ money which have been coyned fr{om} time to time since the reign of H. 8. but find I cannot do it in any convenient time there being no records remaining in the Mint ancienter then the return of Cha II & I When 21 Tenn millions of hammered money were brought into th Since I first perused Mr Polixfin's iscourse about Paper-cre{di}t I have been endeavouring to get an account of the  quantities of hammered money aboutof Gold & ☾ which have been coyned from time to time since the reign of Edw VI in order to make a judgment  upon the causes of the increase & decrease of the coynage but have not yet been able to compass my designe the records thereof befor the year 1669 being taking out of {that}. And therefore least I should detein his paper in my hands too long I have here set down  such observations upon it as at present occurr to me from such  accounts of the coyn as are commonly known I agree with him in the main of his argument set down in sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 that too  much paper credit in proportion to money is not sage &  every nation where  such credit is large & upon the increase &  money upon the decrease ought to take case, before it be too late, least it prove bankrup{t} to support  it. For paper credit is a sort of riches & riches incline men to luxury & luxury promotes the expence of forreigne far fetcht commodities & by consequence the exportation of money to pay for them But in examining how far  England has already been dammaged by the rise & growth of such credit I could wish we had  distincter accounts of the coynage then those heretofore laid before the house of Commons. //Out of those papers Mr P. (section  14, 15, 16, 17 represented that 20 years before Notes had a currency  vizt from 1640 to 1600 there was coyned in the tower in silver money 400000li communibus annis  that from 1660 to anno 1680 there was not coyned above 200000li per annum including the Harp & Cross money &  the price of Dunkirk.  And that from anno 1680 to anno 1695 there was not coyned above 80000li including the money from the wreck & that since the year 1695 we have  coyned   very little forreign bullion so that the coynage since the currency of notes that is since 1660 hath been {upd} the decrease.   By the 400000 per annum coyned in the first 20 years was of both  gold & silver  according to the above mentioned paper & it does not appear that the coynage of silver alone in those  coynage ever since  the establishment of the Company 1657 is  invalid, being contradicted by matter of fact. In the first year of the present reign before the French war began much to affect us  vizt from Dec 31 1688 to Dec 31 1689 there was coyned 234647. 18. 4 & in the next five years  but 70000li per annum  this great & sudden decrease of the coynage being occasioned  not by paper credit or the ordinary East India Trade but by the decay of trade & expences & losses which the French war occasioned vizt in paying the Dutch for their Fleet which brought the Kingdom our assistance in maintaining armies in Ireland & Flanders, in buying naval stores, & in repairing the losses of the East India & other Merchants at sea,  These things not only put a stop to the coynage of silver but  caused it to be exported in considerable quantities   whereby the silver coyn has for the last 100 years been greatly upon the decrease. How much the coyn in these 10 years has decreased is difficult to reccon. There has been coyned in gold {from} Dec 31 1689 to Dec 31 1699 2059384li. 11s. 1d. And if the Guineas & French & Spanish  Pistols which flowed into England  when Guineas were at 30s —. & afterwards at 22s a piece  be recconed between one & two millions the whole increase of Gold in these last 10 years will be between 3 & 4 millions. The hammered silver moneys brought to the Mints to be recoined were about 10 millions of which I reccon above a million to be counterfeit money made  out of Clippings & milled or other weighty money sometimes allayed & some times without allay. This being subducted there remains less than nine millions of geniune money coyned in the Kings Mint.   {which with} the counterfeit money when recoyned made  6600000li  {be}sides 300000li coyned out of Plate, so{ll} that by the recoynage there was lost in the tale of the  genuine hammered money two millions or   or two & a quarter:  which loss arose partly from the wearing of the money & partly from clippings melted down & exported or run into p{l}ate.  If the wearing be recconned at about 600000li (as by weighing some unclipt hammered money I find it may be) there will remain less then two millions lost by clippings melted down & exported  & there is wanting about 3 millions of the milled  silver money coyned above 10 years ago. [And above 12 a million of broad hammered money which for the two last years has been constantly flowoing out of the country to London has been either run into plate or exported. So that there is wanting from the ☾ monies about 512 millions except that about 300000 has been  coyned out of plate. This being subducted from the 512 millions leaves 5 millions or something more want. From which take the 312 millions of ☉ & there will be about 112 or 2 millions of money less now then 10 years ago The Gold & Silver coyned between the death of K. ChaI & the return. of K.C.II & afterwards recoyned was about million that is per annum about 8{8}000li  & in the first 813 years about 733300l. Subduct this from the  Gold & Silver monies coyned from the last of March 1638 to May 1657 which according to one of the Accounts mentions by Mr Polixf. was 7733521. 13s. 4d12 & there will remain about  seven millions coyned from the last of March 163 to the death of K. Cha I which was per annum about 646 thousands pounds per an. For in this Kings reign Gold & Silver money flowed in from  Spain & was coyend here for  provisions which we supplied them with untill  peace was concluded between Span & Holland anno 1648. But afterwards the coynage  abated & became but the 8th or 10th part of what it was before, so that in the next 18 years from the death of K. Cha. I  till the  making of the coynage Act there was coyned in both gold & silver (including the money for Dunkirk) but 1228917li. 12s. 3d. recconing Guineas at 21s. 6d., which coynage was but about 68 thousands pounds per annum. But since the making of that Act the coynage has been exceedingly augmented  being constantly great & upon the increase untill the French war put a stop to it. For in the first 9 years of that Act that is from Dec 21 1666 to Dec 21 1675 it was after the rate of 250000li per annum & in the next 9 years vizt to Dec 1684 it was after the rate of 500000l per annum & in the next 4 years vizt to Dec 31 1688 it was after the rate of 680000li per an Whence it  appears 1 that the Coynage Act has been of vast advantage to the nation. 2 Tha{t} the coyn  notwithstanding the clipping melting & exporting thereof & the disadvantageous trade with {illeg} India & the northern crowns the rebuilding of {London} & the luxury of the English did notably increase till the beginning of the late French war & was more upon the increase at the  beginning of that war then at any other time  since the reign of K. Cha. I. & thirdly that therefore paper credit till the beginning of that war did the nation more service by promoting trade then disservice by promoting luxurity.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Reference of 23 November last we 
        have enquired into the Case of Mr Antony Redhead late Master & 
        Worker of the Mint at Norwich & find it truly stated in the annexed 
        paper on which the said Reference is endorsed. And particularly by the Daybooks of that Mint & the Cash books of Mr Redhead & his Clerk and another book composed & signed by the Warden of that Mint we find that Mr Redhead upon the breaking up of that Mint was indebted 2497li. 16s. 3d to Mr  Blofeld for hammered money at 5s per ounce. In discharge of this Debt Mr Redhead produces three Receipts for 2500li paid to Mr Blofelds Order out of that Mint, the one dated Aug 26 1697 for 500li the other two dated Aug 30 & Sept 1 1697 for 1000li each. To which Mr Blofeld & his friends answer that whatever summs were paid to him or his Order out of that Mint upon such private Receipts, were intended upon the next accounting to be brought to account & set off upon the Printed {M}int Tickets then payable in course & accordingly were all of them faithfully  brought to account as he is ready to make oath.

They say also that about three weeks after the date of the said three Receipts vizt on 22th Sept 1697  Mr Blofeld account with Mr Redhead & endorsed 14922li on two Mint tickets including all summs paid to him untill that time & that is  so short a time as three weeks so great a summ as 2500l could not be forgot & that  in December following he accounted again & endorsed 6443li. 13s. 9d on two other Mint Tickets including all further summs paid untill that day. By which Accountings & Endorsements the said three Receipts (if they be true ones) being   looked upon as discharged they were not mentioned any further by Mr Redhead while that Mint stood nor for a long time after but lay neglected till he thought fit to produce them, as he did also some other Receipts of the same kind which the Importers neglected to take up & cancell, & which  are no allowed to be voyd.

Allen Clerk to the Warden of that Mint made before my Lord Chief Baron Ward on the 3d of Iuly 1701 & by other circumstances it appears to us that Mr Dashwood did account for that money & neglect to take up & cancell the Receipt,  & this is now acknowledged also by Mr Redhead.  About the same time he the said Mr Redhead produced also two other Receipts of the aforesaid Mr Blofeld besides the three above mentioned both dated in the same month of August 1697 the one for 500li & the other for 1000li, but by the aforesaid Affidavit of r Allen these summs were accounted for upon the same 22th of Sept. 1697 & Mr Redhead insists no further upon them. And the said Mr Allen in the same Affidavit affirms further that he hath heard & believes that Mr Redhead hath another Note of Mr Blofeld for 1000li & believes that Mr Blofeld forgot to take up that Note when he accompted for the money & signed the printed Receipt or Ticket : which Note we take to be one of the three Receipts now produced by Mr Redhead.

May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Reference of 23 Novembr last we have 
        enquired into the Case of Mr Antony Redhead late Master & Worker of 
        the Mint at Norwich and find it truly stated in the annexed paper on 
        which the said Reference is endorsed. And particularly by the Day-books of that Mint & the Cashbooks of Mr Redhead & his Clerk & another book composed & signed by the Warden of that Mint we find that Mr Redhead upon the breaking up of that Mint was indebted 2497li  16s 3d to Mr Leonard Blofeld for hammered money at 5s per ounce. And whereas in discharge of this debt he produces three Receipts for 2500li paid to Mr Blofelds Order out of that Mint the one dated Aug. 26 1697 for 500li the other two dated Aug 30 & Sept. 1 1697 for 1000li each: we find that Mr Blofeld did within three weeks after, vizt 22 Sept 1697 account with Mr Redhead for what monies he had then received out of that Mint & endorsed the whole amounting to 14922li on two printed Mint Tickets but neglected to take up & cancell his Receipts of some of them, & we humbly conceive that the said three Receipts were then accounted for & are discharged by the said endorsement & ought not to be insisted on any further and Mr Redhead does not any longer insist peremptorily upon them but submits them to your Lordships Wisdom. They are in the form of private Receipts & so cannot be allowed by an Auditor as Vouchers We further lay before your Lordship that Mr Redhead at the conclusion of 
        that Mint was indebted to Mr Chaplin a Receiver of the Land Tax for 2573oz. 5dwt. 
        of hammered money at 5s per ounce the summ of 643li. 6s. 3d, & that in 
        Mr Chaplins Account which is past & declared & a Quietus obtained Mr Redhead 
        is set insuper & that only at 5s per ounce. Mr Redhead was also indebted to four other  Receivers Mr Briggs, Mr Rendal, Mr Clark & Thorowgood in the respective summs of 882li. 7s. 6d, 1277li. 16s. 3d, 431li. 2s. 6d & 40li. 6s. 3d. for all which his  Receipts stand out against him. And these & all the other debts above mentioned for silver imported amount to 5772li. 15s. 00d, part of which debt has arisen from the application of the Importers money to other services of the Mint for which he has allowance in his Accompt now ready to be laid before your Lordship & for the Remainder Mr Neale is to be set insuper & his Administrix or security to be charged therewith, Mr Redhead seeming poor & unable to make satisfaction, &  not unfit to be set at liberty upon baile so soo as it may be done by the consent of all parties concerned. To the Right Honourable the Lord Treasurer of England.  May it please your Lordship  In obedience to your Lordships Reference of 23 November last we have enquiredinto the Case of Mr Antony Redhead late Master & Worker of the Mint at Norwich & find it truly stated in the annexed paper on which the said Reference is endorsed. And particularly we  the Day-books on that Mint & the Cashbooks of Mr Redhead & his Clerk & another book composed and signed by the Warden of that Mint we find that Mr Redhead upon the breaking up of that Mint was indebted 2497li. 16s. 3d to Mr Leonard Blofeld for hammered money at 5s per ounce. In discharge of this debt Mr Redhead produces three Receipts for 2500li
paid to Mr Blofelds Order out of that Mint, the one dated Aug. 26 1697 for 500li
the other two dated Aug 30 & Sept. 1 1697 for 1000li each. To which 
        Mr Blofeld & his friends answer that whatever summs were paid to him 
        or his Order out of that Mint upon such private Receipts were paid in course for silver imported & intended upon 
        the next accounting to be brought to account & set off upon the printed Mint 
        Tickets then payable in course & accordingly were all of them faithfully 
        brought to account as he is ready to make oath: but the Receipts were 
        not always taken up & cancelled as they should have been the endorsment 
        on the printed Mint Tickets, as they conceived, implying according to the order 
        & course of the Mint that all summs paid untill the day of the endorsment were then accounted for & set off upon the printed Tickets & thereby all private Receipts of such summs untill that day discharged and 
        made voyd which made him & his Agents less carefull to take them up. 
        They say also that about three weeks after the date of the said three 
        Receipts vizt on 22th Sept 1697 Mr Blofeld accounted with Mr Redhead 
        & endorsed 14922li on two Mint Tickets  including all 
        summs paid to him untill that time & that in so short a time as three 
        weeks so great a summ as 2500 could not be forgot, & that in December 
        following he accounted again & endorsed 6443li. 13s. 9d on two other Mint 
        Tickets including all further summs untill that day: By which Accountings 
        & endorsements the said three Receipts (if they be true ones) being 
        looked upon as discharged they were not mentioned any further by 
        Mr Redhead while that Mint stood nor for a long time after but 
        lay neglected till he thought fitt to produce them, as he did also some 
        other Receipts of the same kind which the Importers neglected to take 
        up & cancel & which are now allowed to be voyd. In examining this matter we find therefore that Mr Redhead 
        did pay several summs of money to Mr Blofeld & some other Importers 
        upon private Receipts without endorsing the summs upon the printed Mint 
        Tickets untill they came to a general recconing upon the Ticket or Tickets 
        next payable in course, & that the Importers did sometimes upon such a 
        recconing neglect to take up their Receipts. That Mr Blofeld did endorse 14922li
 <493v> 
        
        on two Tickets 22 Sept 1697, & 6443li. 13s. 9d more on two others in Decem{ber}
following as he alledged & we humbly conceive those endorsements by the cou{rse}
of the Mint to be in full of all moneys paid upon those Tickets so as to 
        voyd the said three Receipts unless Mr Redhead can positively prove the 
        payment of more money by 2500li upon the two first of those Tickets 
        then was Endorsed upon them, which proof is wanting & would infer the cri{me}
of undue preference. The Officers of that Mint for preventing misrecconings took an account every two or three days & sometimes dayly of 
        all the monies new coyned & paid away & of what remained in the 
        Treasury, whereby a misrecconing of 2500li might soon have been 
        discovered: whereas those three Receipts lay neglected till about Michael{mas}
1699  which was two years after the endorsement, Mr Redhead representing that he then found the amongst his paper. About the same time he found also and produced a Receipt of 1858li left in that 
        Mint by Mr Dashwood another  Importer of publick Hammered 
        money; but by an Affidavit of Mr Tho Allen Clerk to the Warden 
        of that Mint made before my Lord Chief Baron Ward the 3d of Iuly 
        1701 & by other circumstances it appears to us that Mr Dashwood did 
        account for that money & neglect to take up & cancel the Receipt 
        & this is now acknowledged also by Mr Redhead. Add about the same time 
        the said Mr Redhead produced also two other Receipts of the aforesa{id}
Mr Blofeld besides the three above mentioned both dated in the same 
        month of August 1697 the one for 500li the other for 1000li, but 
        by the aforesaid Affidavit of Mr Allen these summs were accounted 
        for upon the same 22th of Sept. 1697 & Mr Redhead insists no
        further upon them. Seeing therefore that Mr Blofeld upon accounting 
        22th Sept 1697 did neglect to take up & cancel some of his Receipts then 
        accounted for, it may be suspected that he neglected to take up the rest amongst which are the three now produced. For the said Mr Allen in 
        the Affidavit above mentioned affirms further that he hath heard & 
        believes that  Mr Redhead hath another Note of Mr Blofeld for 1000li & 
            believes that Mr Blofeld forgot to take up that Note when he accompted 
            for the money & signed the printed Receipt or Ticket: which Note we 
            take to be one of the three Receipts now produced by Mr Redhead. And 
        Mr Redhead himself affirms nothing further of the said three Receipts then 
        that he found them amongst his papers sometime after that Mint broke up 
        & believes them to be truely signed by Mr Crowne who was imployed by 
        Mr Demee the Agent of Mr Blofeld. They are in the form of private Receipts so that without Mr Blofelds consent they cannot be allowed by an Auditor either in Mr Redheads Accompt or in that of Mr Blofeld which is now passing. All things being considered we are humbly of opinion that they have already been accompted for & ought not to be insisted upon a further. And Mr Redhead himself does not any longer insist peremptorily upon them but submits them to your Lordships wisdome. We further lay before your Lordship that Mr Redhead at the conclusion of the Mint at Norwich was indebted to one Mr Chaplain a Receiver of the Land Tax for 2573oz 5dwt of hammered money at 5s per ounce the summ of 643li. 6s. 3d, & that in  Mr Chaplains Accompt which is past & declared &
        
         <494r> 
        
        a Quetes obteined, Mr Redhead is set insuper for this debt at 5s 8d per ounce, whereas Mr Neale should have been set insuper, & that only at 5s per ounce. Mr Redhead was also indebted to four other Receivers Mr  Briggs Mr Fendal, Mr Clark & Mr Thorowgood in the respective summ{s} of 882. 7. 6 1277li. 16s. 3d, 431li. 2s. 6d & 40li. 6s. 3d: for all which his  Receipts stand out against him. And these & all other debts above mentioned for silver imported amount to 5772li. 15s. 0d: part of which debt has arisen from the application of the Importers money to other services of the Mint for which he has allowance in his Accompt now ready to be laid before your Lordship,
        & for the Remainder  Mr Neale is to be set insuper, & his Executive or Security to be  charged with it, Mr  Redhead seeming poor & unable too   make satisfaction excepting the          for which his goods have been sold."

This recconing was at a Medium 
          
    But there are secrets & mysteries in trade which cannot be brought to any recconing.  And unless competent allowance be made for the same the Dutch will send to London for Tin & undersell the Queen  a Amsterdam. Particularly in the said recconing,  Commission  was put at 9d per , whereas the Dutch can have their buisiness done by the Pewterers at 6d.  Insurance at sea was put at 9d whereas the Dutch in times of peace will not reccon it at 3d. And interest for two months forbearance was put at 9st whereas the Dutch who can borrow money at four per cent will reccon it but at 6st  And freight was put at 313 stivers whereas the Dutch can have  Tin brought home upon their own bottoms sometimes at  half the price, & sometimes  for ballast. And if upon all these considerations about 1s 2d be abated the remaining price will be  4li 4s 6d.
         The Duties paid by her Majesty in Holland for the Tin now there amounted to 1 Gilder 5{56}  per 100 Dutch weight,  that is  is about 2912d per  english. But  a Dutchman  usually contrives to have his Tin put on board several ships for lessening the charge of freight & to run as much of it as he can  & what they cannot run they endeavour by their acquaintance to get taxed low. And what allowance to make for these practises I know not. If only 6d per  should be allowed, it would bring down the price to 4li. 4s. 0d per  English to be turned into Dutch money per Dutch weight from time to time according to the course of the Exchange. Out of this price a deduction is to be made of one per cent Commission one per cent prompt payment one per cent insurance of payments & one per cent Brokerage & charges at the city weigh-house  in all four per cent or 3s 4d14 per : besides 2d per  for ware house room.

This charge Mr Beranger in the presence of my Lord Treasurer recconed  at 5d in changing Specie money into Bank money. 
         In the discourse between Mr Beranger & me no mention was made of Vsance. For it was proposed between us that he himself should to his Lordships Order the price to be set by his Lordship clear of all charges  for so much Tinn as he should sell, & account of the  payments before an Auditor provided he could have good vouchers for the same payments, & that the returns or payments should be made without two months after the sales, that time being given to the buyer    Considering the great quantity of the Tinn & that Mr Beranger does not live in Holland, His Lordship when ever it shall be thought fit may send over an Agent to oversee the Sales & Accounts & keep a recconing if them  & of the Tynn remaining have  of keys too  each Warehous where the Tinn is laid up till it shall begin to be sold.

        The Lady Paul And this pirce, as the Exchange goes now would amount to  4612 Gilders per 100 weight Dutch. The charges of sending Tynn to Amsterdam (in the Account drawn up by me) amounted to 4li. 3s. 1112 per  weight to which I added the interest of two months forbearance of payments after sale at 6 per cent & the allowance of one per cent for prompt payment at the end of that time; both amoounting to 20d12 per . And these summs added made the selling price 4li 5s 8d per  English weight, to be turned into Dutch money per  100 Dutch weight according to the course of the Exchange for the time being. This recconing was made at a medium, or rather favoured the Queen more then the Dutch. But there are uncertainties & secrets & mysteries in trade which cannot be brought to any recconing And unless competent allowance be made for ht e same the Dutch will send to London for Tynn & undersell the Queen's Agent at Amsterdam. Particularly, in the said recconing, Commission for buying Tinn at the Tower was put at 9d whereas the Dutch can have their business done by the Pewterers for six pence Insurance at sea was put at 9d whereas the Dutch in times of peace will not reccon it at 3d. Interest for two months forbearance was put at 9 stivers per 100 weight, whereas the Dutch who can borrow money at 4 per cent will reccon it but at 6 stivers per 100 weight. And freight was put at 313 stivers per 100 weight, whereas the Dutch can have Tynn brought home upon their own bottomes  sometimes at half that price & sometimes for ballast. And if upon all these considerations about 14d be abated, the remaining price will be 4li 4s 6d per . The Dutues paid by her Majesty in Holland for the Tynn now there, amounted to 1v Gilder, 556 styvers per  100 Dutch  weight, that is to about 2912d per  English. But a Dutch-man usually contrives to have his Tin put on board several ships for lessening the charge of freight, & too runn as much of it as he can; & what they cannot runn they endeavour by their acquaintance to get taxed low. And what allowance to make for these practises I do not know. If only 6d per  should be allowed it would bring down the price to 4li 4s 0d  per , to be turned into Dutch money per Dutch  weight  according to the course of the Exchange for the time being. And this price as the Exchange goes now, would
        
         <536v> 
        
        amount to 4612 Gilders per 100 weight Dutch. Out of this price a deduction is to be made of one per cent Commission, one per cent prompt payment, one per cent insurance of payments, 13 per cent Brokerage, 16 per cent carriage to the city Weigh house & weighing for sale, 12 per cent City Duty at the weigh house, & 15 per cent warehouse roome, in all 415 per cent, or 3s. 6d14 per  weight. Which being deducted from 4li 4s 0d leaves 4li. 0s. 534d clear of all charges except the charges of returning the moneys for which the Tynn is sold. And this charge Mr Beranger (in the presence of my Lord Treasurer) recconed at 5d in changing specie money into Bank money. In the discourse between Mr Beranger & me about this matter, no mention was made of Vsance. For it was proposed between us that he himself should pay to his Lordships Order the price to be set by his Lordship  clear of all charges for so much Tin as he should sell & account for the payments before an Auditor provided he could have good & unquestionable vouchers for the payments, & that the payments or returns should be made within two months after the sales, that time being given to the buyer. Considering the great quantity of the Tinn & that Mr Beranger does not live in Holland as Mr Drummond did, MLord Treasurer, when ever it shall be thought fit, may send over an Agent to oversee the sales & Accounts & tynn remaining & keep a recconing thereof, & perhaps have one of the keys to each warehouse where the Tinn is laid up till it shall begin to be sold out of that warehouse. When the late Lord Treasurer,  set the selling price of the Tynn at 4412 Gilders  per 100 Dutch weight. The Exchange  with Amsterdam was at 34sc. 6d Bank money. tis now at 35sc 9d. and this brings up   my Lord Godolphins  price to 46 Gilders 2st per 100 Dutch weight. But  at 4li 4s per  English weight, the price will be 47 Gilders  supposing the Agio 413 per cent. Which price being 18st  (or 20d) per  more then  by my Lord Godolphins  recconing. I doubt whether the Tin will sell readily at a price answering to 4li. 4s per  & therefore believe 4li per  clear of all charges to be a good price if it can be had without clogging the sale of the Tinn. In the Account drawn up by me, the charges of sending Tynn to Amsterdam  together with the interest of two months forbearance of payments after sale at 6 per cent, & the allowance of one per cent for prompt payment at the end of that time, amounted to 4li 5s 8d per  English weight, to be turned into Dutch money per 100 Dutch weight according to the course of the Exchange for the time being, for setting a price upon  Her Majestys Tynn in the market at Amsterdam. This recconing was made at a Medium, or rather favoured the Queen something more then the Dutch.  For there are uncertainties, secrets & mysteries in trade which can never be brought to an exact recconing. And unless competent allowance be made for the same the Dutch will send to London for Tynn & undersell the Queens Agent at Amsterdam. Particularly, in the said recconing, a Dutch Commission for buying Tynn at London was put at 9d per  weight, whereas the Dutch can have their business done by the Pewterers for six pence Insurance at Sea was put at 9d whereas the Dutch in times of peace will not reccon it at 3d. Interest for two months forbearance was put at 9d stivers per 100 weight whereas the Dutch who can borrow money at 4 per cent will reccon it but at 6stivers per 100 weight. And freight was put at 313 stivers per 100 weight, whereas the Dutch can have Tynn brought home upon their own bottoms sometimes at half that price & sometimes for ballast. And if upon all these considerations about 14d be abated, the remaining price will be 4li 4s 6d per  english weight. The Duties paid by her Majesty in Holland for the Tynn now there, amounted to 1 Gilder 556 styvers per 100 Dutch weight, that is, to about 2912d per  English weight. But  a Dutch man usually contrives to have his Tynn put on board several ships for lessening the charge of freight & to run as much of it as he can, & what they cannot runn they endeavour by their acquaintance to get taxed low. And I know not what allowance to make for these
    
     <548v> 
    
    practises. If only 6d be allowed per  weight, it will bring down the selling price to 4li. 4s. 0d per  to be turned into Dutch money per 100 Dutch weight according to the course of the Exchange for the time being. And this price as the Exchange goes now, would amount to 4612 Gilders per 100 weight Dutch. Out of this price a deduction is to be made of one per cent Commission, one per cent prompt payment, one per cent Insurance of payments, 13 per cent Brokerage, 16 per cent carriage to the City weigh-house & weighing foor sale, 12 per cent city Duty at the Weigh-house, & 15 per cent Warehouse room: in all 415 per cent or 3s 614d per  weight english. Which being deducted from 4li. 4s. 0d leaves 4li. 0s. 534d clear of all charges except the charge of returning the moneys for which the Tynn is sold. And this charge Mr Beranger (in the presence of my Lord Treasurer) recconed at 5d in changing specie money into Bank money. In the discourse between Mr Beranger & me about this matter, no mention was made of Vsance. For it was proposed between us that he himself should pay to his Lordships Order the price to be set by his Lordship clear of all charges for so much Tinn as he should sell & account for the payments before an Auditor provided he could have very good Vouchers for the payments, & that the payments or returns should be made within two months after the sales, that tiem being given to the buyer. Considering the great quantity of the Tynn & that Mr Beranger doth not live in Holland as Mr Drummond did, My Lord Treasurer, when ever it shall be thought fit, may send over an Agent to oversee the sales & accounts & Tynn remaining unsold & keep a recconing thereof, & perhaps have  one of the keys to each Warehouse where the Tynn is laid up till it shall begin to be sold out of that Ware-house. The surest method for setting a price upon the Tynn at Amsterdam is to know the price of the Tynn in the market of Amsterdam at any certain time & the course of the Exchange at that time & thence to compute the price by the course of the Exchange at this present time. When the Lord Treasurer Godolphin set the price at 4412 Gilders per 100 weight Dutch, the price in the market was from 45 to 47 Gilders as I find by Mr Drummonds Letter; & his Lordship abated half a Gilder to make room for the varying of the Exchange. At that time the Exchange was at 34{ss} 6d. Tis now at 35{ss} 10d. And as 34{ss} 6d to 35{ss} 10d so is 45 Guilders (the lowest price in the market at that time) to 46G. 15st the lowest price in the market suitable to the course of the Exchange at this time. This price answers to 4li 3s 5d per  weight English. Last summer when the Exchange came down to 34{ss} or under, the lowest price of the Tinn in the market was 4412 Gilders. And at that rate the lowest price now ought to be 46G 15st or 47G. And this price answers to 4li. 3s. 6d, or 4li. 4s. per  weight English. In the Account lately drawn up by me, the price came to 4li. 5s. 8d per wt English. But to bring it to the lowest price of the market some abatements must be made. A Dutch Commission for buying Tynn at the Tower was there put at 9d per  weight whereas the Dutch  can have their buisiness done by the Pewterers for 6d. Insurance at sea was there put at 9d whereas the Dutch in times of peace will not value it at 3d. Interest for two months forbearance of payments was put at 9 stivers per 100wt Dutch, whereas the Dutch who can borrow money at 4 per cent will reccon it but at 6 stivers per 100wt. And freight was put at 313 stivers per 100 weight whereas the Dutch can have Tynn brought home upon their own bottoms sometimes at half that price sometimes for ballast. If upon all these accounts about 14d per  weight be abated the remaining price will be  4li 4s 6d per  weight. And further there must be an abatement out of the Duties paid in Holland, which in the said Account amounted to 1 Gilder 556 stivers per 100wt. For a Dutchman
        
         <550v> 
           
           usually contrives to have his Tynn put on board several ships for lessening the charge of freight, & to run as much of it as he can, & what they cannot run they endeavour by their acquaintance to get taxed low. And I know not what abatement to make for these practises. If only 6d be abated per  weight, the remaining price will be 4li. 4s. per  weight; if 1s, it will be 4li. 3s. 6d. By all these recconings the lowest price of Tynn per 100wt  in the Dutch markets should answer to 4li 3s 6d or 4li. 4s. per  weight English. For I know not how to be more exact in this slippery recconing where the uncertainties secrets & mysteries of trade cannot be brought to a certainty. Out of this price a deduction is to be made of one per cent Commission; one per cent prompt payment, one per cent Insurance of payments if the Queen insures, 13 per cent Brokerage, 16 per cent carriage to the city weighouse & weighing for sale, 12 per cent City Duty at the weigh house, 15 per cent Warehouse room: in all 415 per cent of 3s 6d per  weight. And the remaining price will be 4li, or 4li. 0s. 6d clear of all charges, except what shall be allowed for returning the money for which the Tynn shall be sold. For Mr Beranger insisted upon 5d per  weight for turning specie money into Banck money & making returns. In the discourse betwwen Mr Beranger & me he proposed to sell the Tynn himself by his Agents & pay the produce clear of all charges to his Lordships Order, & account for the same before an Auditor provided he could have good vouchers. And he is still willing to undertake this Considering the great quantity of the Tynn, & that Mr Beranger does not live in Holland as Mr Drummond did an Agent when ever it shall be thought fit, may be sent into Holland to oversee the Sales & Accounts & Tynn remaining & keep a recconing thereof & perhaps have one of the keys to each Ware house where the Tynn is laid up   till it shall begin to be sold out of that warehouse."

His Lordship  thinks that the Pix of that Mint may be still tried before her Majesties Council  in Scotland as formerly & if so we are humbly of opinion that  in  conformity to the Act of Vnion there may be made seven Trial pieces of Crown gold & seven of standard silver  two of each metal for  the two  Treasuries to try   the Pixes two of each for the  Wardens of the two Mints to  try the moneys before delivery, two of each for the Masters of each Mint to make the moneys by & one of each for the Wardens & Company of Goldsmiths in London to  try their plate & manufactures of gold & silver. 
         It will be also convenient that a Pile of standard weights be made for the Treasury in Scotland by the Deputy Chamberlains of the Exchequer The Gravers are making shillings Puncheons  with the arms of great Britain which may be sent to the Mint at Edinborough: And while they are coyning shillings, there may be puncheons made for other money. We believe it may be sufficient to send them Puncheons with two or three pairs of Dyes of every sort for patterns.  For distinguishing the money coyned at Edinburgh from that coyned in London there may be the  letter E  set  under her Majesties Effigies. If it be thought fit there may be dues of the old form sent them for coyning sixpences & shillings  untill Puncheons of the new form can be made, which  we hope will be in a fortnight or three weeks. In the late recoynage of the hammered money in England in every hundred pounds there were ten pounds coyned in sixpences & 40 pounds in shillings, & the Master of the Mint at Edinborough may be obliged  to keep the same proportions during the recoinage in that Mint. The Pile of Standard weights  should be delivered at the Tower by the {Warden} to the General of the Mint in Scotland Scotland by Bill indented under their hands, may in the absence of the General be delivered to your Lordships order to be conveyed or sent to that Mint, the same being first printed with a Rose & Thistle growing upon one common stalk &  crowned with one common crown, And the Date being stamped upon it."

And in the first five Indentures the summ & Sureties are named, in the four last they are not named, the summ named is usually 500li. In the Indenture made An. 2, Elizab. mention is made that the Vnder Treasurer of the Mint hath found sureties before the Queen in Chancery in 1000li that upon pain thereof he shall make gree to the Queen & to the Merchant. In the Indenture made An. 3 Eliz. it is said that the Master & Worker hath bound himself in 500li & found sureties in other 500li that upon pain thereof he shall make gree to the Queen & to the Merchant. The Queen is joyned with the Merchant because {she} recoyned the money of her Predecessors. In the Indentures made An 14 Eliz An 2 Iac I, An 3 Iac I, An 10 Iac I, An 2 Car. I, An 12 Car II. An 22 Car II mention is made that the Master & Worker hath found sureties in the summ of 2000li before her or his Majesty in Chancery that upon pain thereof he shall make gree to the Queen or King & to the Merchant. The Commissioners for Mr Slingsby gave bond  9th August 1680 in 2000li a piece in the Exchequer before they took the Oath of Office In the Indentures of An. 1 Iac II, & An 1 Gul III made to Mr Neale (who was expensive & in debt &  insinuated himself indirectly into the Office) there is  a Covenant that the Master & Worker shall find such Borrows & Sureties in their Majestys Court of Exchequer in such summ as the Commissioners  of the Treasury or High Treasurer of England for the time being shall approve of that upon pain thereof he shall make gree to their Majesties & to the Merchant according to the said Indenture. And after the passing of the first Indenture he did find sureties in 15000li but after the passing of the second he found none. Q. 1 Ought the Master & Worker upon his first beginning to receive the Merchants Bullion & the Queens money to find sureties that he shall make gree to the Queen & to the Merchant or ought he to do it immediately before he makes Oath to the Indenture of the Mint, or should he be then bound upon Oath to do it afterwards. This is in the {heast} of my Lord Treasurer to order as he shall Iudge best, To me it seems most reasonable to follow ancient presidents & take the security before the makeing the Indenture & not to leave it to the masters covenant or oath that he will after give security.  Q. 2 For making sure that the Master doth find sureties is it not fit to mention in the Indenture that the Master hath found sureties so that an Indenture may not be sealed to him till he hath found them. I think it is best to follow the ancient presidents & mention in the Indenture that the Master hath found security  Q 3. Ought the Master to find Sureties to observe all the Covenants of the Indenture, there being other punishments for the breach of such Covenants as do not create a debt & an Oath for the Observance of them & no mention in any Indenture of finding such Sureties, & some Covenants depending on the performance of other Officers who give no security.

        furnace to be built in order to a further trial of what may 
        be done by casting of copper into Barrs & coyning copper money 
        out of those barrs, But in the mean time upon assaying the half pence 
        of which I shewed your Lordship a specimen, I found the copper 
        coarser then it was by the assay before casting. Whereupon I 
        ordered Mr Bagley the founder to supply me with such barrs 
        as would fully endure the assay: but he has not yet produced 
        any tho it be about three weeks since I gave him the order. Whence I 
        suspect that in the specimen of half pence which I shewed your 
        Lordship, he put in some tynn without my knowledge tho I stood 
        by to see him cast the copper &     He seems to be at a stand in casting fine copper without mixture so as to make it run close & fully endure the assay by the hammer after casting;  Which makes a further tryal unnecessary. Mr Kemp agrees with me that the proper assay of fine copper  is by the hammer.  If  the fillets of Copper be made by hammering & be assayed by the hammer the money will be of the same fineness with the copper money of Sweden:  If they be cast it will scarce be so fine. in the first case the workmanship as well as the metall will cost more & the work be more beautifull, & the assay more certain & the method of coynage  more easily setled then in the second.
    
     In the second an assay by  refining as well as by the hammer may be usefull. But as there is a power in the Mint of refusing such gold & silver as is not made fit to be received so it should be in Copper. If the Sir Isaac Newton Report about Coyning Copper Farthings & halfe pence Mint Office 12 Apr. 1714  May it please your Lordship  Since I attended your Lordship last, I caused a new furnace to be 
        built in order to a further trial of what may be done by casting 
        of copper into barrs for making of copper money. But in the 
        mean time upon assaying the half pence of which I shewed

He seems to be at a stand in casting fine copper without mixture so as to make it runn close & fully endure the  Assay by the Hammer: which makes a further trial unnecessary. Mr Kemp agrees with me that the proper assay of fine copper is by the hammer. If the barrs or fillets of copper be made by hammering & be assayed by the hammer, the money will be of the same fineness with the copper money of Sweden & with that of King Charles II: If they be cast, it will scarce be so fine.

There are in the business of the Mint three trialls of Gold & silver directed by the Indenture of the Mint to be made each of them in presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller by sworn Artificers & being made in their presence they are all conclusive & binding against the Master otherwise not The first of these trialls is of Bullion upon any disagreement between the Master & Importer about the price. In such cases the Kings Assaymaster tries the Bullion in the presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller & the Master is then bound to receive it according to such assay altho his own Assaymaster should tell him it is to his loss. The other two trialls are of two pieces taken out of every Iourney of new coyned monies, the one triall of one piece before deliverance of the monies, the other triall of the other piece reserved in a Pix till the time of the triall. These two trialls are in all respects alike excepting that the one is made in the Mint by the Kings Assaymaster & Weigher & Teller sworn at their admission to their Office the other out of the Mint by a number of Assaymasters Weighers & Tellers chosen out of the company of Goldsmiths & sworn before the Lords of the Councill upon every new occasion. For which reason the triall is removed from the Mint to the place where the Council sits. Both these trialls (as well that without as that within the Mint) are to be made before the Warden Master & Comptroller & if the monies prove uncovenable the Master is punished in them both, in the first by recoining them at his own charge in the latter by making satisfaction to the King. So that the Officers of the Mint have the same station in both trialls tho the last Triall be  much more solemn then the other. The last Triall is made not at the suit of the King in any of his usual Courts of Iustice but by vertue of & according to a contract between the King & the Master set down in the said Indenture   & therefore like all the rest of that Indenture is to be looked upon as a part of the business of the Mint. In this contract the Master consents on his part that the Pix shall be opened & assays be made before his Majesty or such of his Council as his Majesty shall appoint & his Majesty consents on his part that the Assays shall be made in presence of the Master & both parties agree that the Assays shall be made in presence of the Warden & Comptroller, the King entrusting them against the Master 
    
     <259v> 
    
    as well with the inspection of the triall by reason of their skill as with the custody & keys of the monies untill the Triall be made. What Artificers and how many shall make the Assays is not said in the Indenture but the custome has been (for the solemnity and credit of the Triall)  not to make use of the Artificers of the Mint but of others chosen out of the Goldsmiths Company to the number of 24 & sworn in manner of a Iury. This is a Iury of enquiry not of judgment.  Their business is not to hear witnesses & debate & judge but only to survey the workmanship of the coyn & try or examin it by experiment according to Art in the presence of both parties & report the bare matter of fact for making up an accompt between them about the coynage unto that day. If upon triall the monies prove worse in weight & fineness then standard and yet within the remedy  the lack thereof is entred of record by the Warden & Comptroller & thereupon the Master becomes proportionally debter to the King if better then standard the King remitts of the debt to the Master if of just weight & allay the recconing is eaven and at the foot of this recconing the Master  has his Acquittance & Quietus under the broad seal whereby he is quit excused & discharged to that day against his Majesty & people from further examination of the matter or molestation about it: but if the money prove without the remedy he makes fine & ransome at the Kings-will. In this Triall therefore the King & the Master are the parties concerned who have referred themselves to this way of Tryall by consent & contract, so that the Master cannot be said to be under prosecution. There is no accusation charge or action against him, no reflexion upon him before the triall be made. Much less do the Warden & Comptroller appear at the barr of a Court of Iustice. Neither are they present as idle & insignificant spectators, but as the Kings Officers necessarily upon duty in their several stations in this Court under the Kings or Lords of the Council then present, it being their buisiness in behalf of his Majesty & People to keep the Keys of the Pix till the day of the triall & then to see that the triall be rightly made & to enter it of record & make a true accompt thereof to the King that the same may be fully answered to his Majesty.

    accordingly are bound to act by the same rules set down in the above mentioned Indenture. Whereby it is plain that the Iury are not to exclude the said Officers of the Mint from any part of the Triall nor to propose to them at any time to withdraw, but that they continue together untill the Veredict be given in, the Officers of the Mint being considered under the same character as if the whole business were transacted in their Office in the Mint. For the business of this Iury being not a judgment made by hearing Witnesses & debating thereupon but a bare report of precise matter of fact: tis not in the power of the Officers of the Mint to influence the Iury by their presence, unless in giving them notice as they ought, where the trialls are not duly made. If the Iury be at liberty to repeat the Assays of weight & fineness till they themselves are satisfied, they can have no reason to complain: and if they are bound to do it till the Officers of the Mint are also satisfied this makes the Trial of greater force to conclude both parties & satisfy the whole Nation then if it depended upon the oaths & skill of  the Iury alone on a triall made in private.  Such a private Triall would not bind the Master because not made according to his contract with the King. Nor perhaps would it be advisable for the King to let the Mint by such private Trialls come into the hands of the Company of Goldsmiths & by being at their mercy be secretly swayd & governed by their interest. And therefore a publick solemn triall is appointed by the Indenture which is the sole grownd of this triall & rule by which they are sworn to proceed in making it. A Memorial concerning the Trial of the Monies in the Pix by a Iury before the King or Lords of the Council and Officers of the Mint.  There are in the business of the Mint three trialls of Gold  and silver  directed by the Indenture of the Mint to be made each of them  in presence of the Warden Master & Worker & Comptroller by sworn Artificers,  & being made  in their presence  they are all conclusive & binding against the Master & Worker, otherwise not.  The first of these trialls is of Bullion upon any disagreement between the Master   & Importer about the price. In such cases the Kings Assaymaster tries the Bullion in the presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller & the Master is then bound to receive it according to such  assay although his own Assaymaster should tell him it is to his loss.  The other two trialls are of two pieces taken out of every Iourney of new coyned monies, the one triall of one piece before deliverance of the monies the other triall of the other piece reserved in a Pix  till the time of the triall.

        Both these trialls (as well  that without as that within the Mint) are to be made before the Warden Master & Comptroller, & if the monies prove uncovenable the Master is punished in them both  in the first

        till they themselves are satisfied they can have no reason to complain And if they are & bound to do it till the King or Lords of the Councill & Officers of the Mint are also satisfied, this makes the Triall of greater force to conclude both parties & satisfy the whole Nation then if it depended upon the oaths & skill of the Iury alone or a triall made private.

Nor perhaps would it be advisable for the King to let the Mint by such private trialls come into the hands of the company of Goldsmiths, & by being at their mercy be secretly swayd & governed by their interest. And therefore a publick solemn triall is appointed by the Indenture, which is the sole ground of this triall &  rule by which they are  to {proceed } in making it. This triall therefore is not a process of law against the Master but only a survey of the moies according to contract for making up accompts between him & the King: so that the Master cannot be  supposed under prosecution. There is no charge or accusation against him no reflexion upon him before the triall be made.  Much less can the Warden & Comptroller be supposed to stand at the barr of a Court of Iustice Neither are they present as idle spectators The reason of trying the monies in  the Pix by a Iury before his Majesty or Lords of the Councill & Officers of the Mint. There are in the business of the Mint three trialls of Gold &  Silver add directed by the Indenture of the Mint to be made   before the Warden Master & Comptroller by sworn Artificers  & being so made they are all conclusive & binding against the Master, otherwise not. The first is of Bullion  as often as the Master & Importer  disagree about the price. In such cases the Kings Assaymaster tries the Bullion before the Waster Master & Comptroller & the the Master is bound to receive it  according to such assay  er accident it should be to his loss. altho his own Assaymaster should tell him it is to the loss  The other two trialls are of two pieces taken out of every  journey of new coyned monies by the Warden, the one triall of one piece before deliverance of the monies the other  triall of the other piece reserved in a Pix  till the time of the triall,  & these two trialls are in all respects alike excepting  that the one  is made by the Kings  Assaymaster & Weigher & Teller sworn  at their admission to their Office the other 
        
        
            
            by a  number of Assaymasters Weighers & Tellers chosen out of the company of Goldsmiths London & 
        
       sworn before the Privy Council  upon every new occasion for which reason the Triall is removed from the mint to the place where the Councill sits If the monies in either triall be  faulty the Master is culpable & suffers in the first of these two trialls    by the  charge of even tho they be recoining them with the remedy in the last day  accounting with the King  bearing defect if they be within a remedy or by fine  & ransome at the Kings will if they be without The triall of the monies in the Pix is therefore appointed to be made before the Warden Master & Comptroller of the Mint not as persons standing at the barr of a court of Iustice for it proceeds without any accusation or reflection upon them before it be made & the veredict given in nor is it made before then  nor as idle & insignificant spectators but as Officers of his Majestys Mint in the execution of the their Officer  whose business it is to see that the triall be  duly made & to enter it of record & make a true accompt thereof to his Majesty & the Goldsmiths are a jury of Assaymasters Weighers & Tellers acting in the place of the Assaymaster & Weigher & Teller of the Mint. For which reason it has been the custome for the said Iury not to exclude the said Officers of the Mint  nor to separate from them but to continue with them during  the Triall untill the  Veredict  be   delivered to the Lord  Chancellour   & for the said Officer to take their places at the trial & at dinner  with the Iury as if the whole proceeding were in the Mint For this Triall is appointed in the Indenture of the Mint as a part of the business of the Mint & accordingly directed in the same Indenture to be made before the Warden Master & Comptroller like the other trialls of  new monies & bullion for giving it force & credit  against the Master & making the Veredict the more  satisfactory to the nation by the consent & approbation of persons of variosu interesits, it being perhaps thought unadvisable to let the Mint  be regulated by the  interest of the company of Goldsmiths alone without a cheque
    
     <263v> 
    
    For the trial depending not upon the oaths of witnesses & debates & judgment of the Iury but upon experiments of  weighing telling & assaying which the  Iury make with their own hands & eyes  without needing any evidence debate or judgment to turn the Ballance tis not in the power of the Officers of the Mint to influence the Iury  where the trialls are duly made.  & therefore they are  made before the said Officers according to the usual course of the Mint that  by giving them satisfaction they may be of the greater force.  but if  the monies be found good & covenable after the covenants in the said Indenture then the Master is quit excused & discharged against {his Majesty} & people, that is not quit of any crime or debt laid to his charge justified in this  performance of his bargain & quit from all further examination of the matter or molestation about it. This triall is made not at the suit of the King in any of his usuall court of Iustice but by vertue of a contract between the King & the Master & Worker set down in the Indenture of the Mint & therefore like all the rest of that Indenture is to be looked upon as a part of the business of the Mint. In this contract the Master on his part {then} consents that the Pix shall be opened & Assays shall be made before his Majesty or such of his Councilll as his Majesty shall appoint & his Majesty consents in his part that the  Assays (meaning both in weight & fineness) shall be made in presence of the Warden Master & Comptroller. Tis agreed For the common satisfaction of both parties  that the Assay be made before them both. What & how many Artificers shall make them  is not said in the Indenture but the custome has been for greater satisfaction to set aside the Artificers of the Mint &  swear a number of others  in the manner of a Iury.  This is a Iury of enquiry not of judgment & their business is    not to hear witnesses & debate & judge but only with their hands & eyes to {illeg} the monies & report the matter of fact for staking & making up an accompt between the King & the Master according to the contract between them.  If the monies prove too feeble the Master becomes debtor to the King accordingly, if too strong the King remitts of the debt to the Master if of just weight & allay  the  recconing is eaven   & the Master  has his quietus under the broad seal,  & the  whereby he is quit excused & discharged  against his Majesty & people from any further examination of the matter or molestation about it; but if the money prove without the remedy the Master makes fine and ransome at the Kings will by vertue of the same contract  In this trial therefore the Warden Master & Comptroller are not to be looked upon as persons standing at the barr of a Court of Iustice, for there is no charge against them no reflexion upon them before the triall be made. Neither are they present as idle & insignificant spectators bit  as the Kings Officers   before the King of Lords of the Councell in their several stations upon duty it being their business to see & satisfy themselves that the triall be rightly made  & so the Wardens & Comptrollers to enter it of  record & make a true accompt thereof to his Majesty. And the Iury are  the Kings Assaymasters Weighers & Tellers acting in the place of the Kings Assaymaster & Weigher & Teller of the Mint &  accordingly sworn to act by the rules set down 
    
     <264r> 
    
    in the Indenture. Whence  the Iury are not to exclude the Officers of the Mint from the triall nor to order them to withdraw but to suffer  them to take their places (as been the custome) bot at the triall & at the dinner in the same order according to their Offices as if the whole buisiness were transacted in the Mint &  to continue with them untill the veredict be given in. For the triall depending not upon the judgment of the Iury but upon  experiments of weighting telling & assaying which the jury make with their own hands & eyes  without needing any witnesses  debates or judgment to turn the ballance, tis not in the power of the Officers of the Mint to  influence the Iury  where the trialls are duly made. If the Iury are at liberty to repeat the  assays of weight & tale till they are satisfied &  bound to do it till the King or Lords of the Council & Officers of the Mint are also satisfied this makes the triall of greater groce to bind all parties &  satisfy the whole nation then if it depended upon the oaths & skill of the Iury alone. For
    
        
        
    Such private trialls would not bind the Master because {not} made according to his contracts with the King,  nor perhaps would it be advisable for the King to let the Mint by such trialls come into the hands of the Company of Goldsmiths &   by being at their mercy be humbly swayd & governed by their interest"

And its more probable that the  Office of Ordnance at their first erection,  for want of a Smiths shop of their own should use the Smith of the Mint then that the  Mint should leave their own Smith with his shop to  make use of the Smith of the Ordnance. 2 In the late recoinage of the money  our Smith lived in the house in dispute & had a fourge or shop now taken from us, &  & half that recoinage was carried  on  in the Irish Mint now taken from us. And the houses which stand empty or are let, ought to be inhabited by the owners or their Deputies for carrying on the service of the Mint. And our Smith is a different Office from our Engineer when they call our Master Smith. It is not superfluous room that we desire but the conveniency of our offices & their lying together & the safety of the coinage for supporting the credit of the Mint with the Merchant, & the custody of our gates for keeping the Mint quiet while the coinage is going on & the money is carrying in Trays from Office to Office  thought the street of the Mint, & that our people may not be discouraged from living in the Mint to attend their business. 3  The Letters Patents to the Smiths of the Ordnance, granting them the place of the  Master Smiths  of all the Iron Works within the Tower of London – cum mansionibus domibus proficuis emolumentis &c do not extend to all the iron works in the Mint  nor alter the property  of the houses in which the iron works of the Mint were performed. 4 In the Depositions no mention is made that the Smith of the Ordnance was also Smith of the Mint. And Mr Wm Smith deposeth what was done before he was born    Robt Fitch deposeth that about the year 1688 or  1689 a Committee of Council came to the Tower to view whether another place in the Tower might be found for the Smith of the Ordnance upon occasion of Mr Slingsby endeavours to remove him. And we have a tradition that the further end of the Mint was then put into the hands of the Office of Ordnance for that purpose.  Let them show what other title they have to it. The Mint in the Tower of London was erected before the Office of Ordnan{ce} & in the Indenture made in the first year of Queen Mary (Aug. 20 1553)  between her Majesty & her Officers of the Mint there was a covenant in these words. And her said Majesty doth grant & confirm by these present ––– or minister of the Tower No mention being here made of any officer of the Ordnance this grant seems to have been first made not only before that Office  had any footing in the Mint but even before that Office was instituted. In the ninth year of Queen Elizabeth (May 3, 1567) William & Martin Hopkins were made Master Smiths to that Office & Martin died 16 Iuly 1606. And in an Indenture made the 14th year of Queen Eliz   (Apr. 19 1572) William Hopkins is mentioned as being then Smith of the Mint with a salary of 10li per annum during life.  He was therefore Smith to both Offices & the Smith of the Mint lived in the house now in dispute. In the year 1577 this hous was put into several repairs necessary to be done with new materials & therefore was built  many years before the year 1567, & might be built for the Smith of the Mint before the Office of Ordnance was erected, & now might be repaired by the Office of Ordnance, by consent of the Mint, in recompence for the use they made of it, & to make it more fit for that use."

The gold monies of Spain are the double Dobleon or four Pistole piece with sixteeen Reales, the Dobleon worth 8 Reales, the single Pistole worth four Realis, the Ecus de Mare or Crown de Mare worth 2 Reales or 16 Reaus or 544 Maravadis.    The silver pieces are the Reale, Piastre or Piece of 8 worth 1 Reale or 8 Reaus of old Plate & 10 of new. For since the year 1686 their monies have been raised 25 per cent, or in the proportion of  4 to 5. The half & quarter pieces of eight called in Ireland half & quarter cobbs worth 4 & 2 Reaus of old plate & 5 & 212. The Reaule of plate or silver worth 34 Maravadies. The Maravadi is a little piece of copper money. Their Pistoles & Pieces of 88 are of the same weight fineness & value with the French Lewidors & Ecus. The Pistoles are accounted 14legr wors their pieces of 88 of Sevil 12dwt worse, those of Mexico 112dwt worse those of Peru 12dwt worse, the Pillar pieces of 88 are 12dwt better.

They have another sort of money called money of Billion which is partly reale of silver & copper mint) & partly imaginary & this money is half the value of the money of Plate, but variable in value.

And of this sort I reccon Mills furnaces, coppels, coats for the Assay office, water silver, Aqua fortis, refining, allay &c. And in this sense the Act has been constantly interpreted, as may be understood by the old Accounts of the Warden & Master. In those Accounts the salaries upon the establishment of the Indenture amounted formerly to 2600li. And the charges of repairs came to two three & sometimes almost 400li more. The Articles in the Masters Accounts for furnaces & charges of assaying refining & allaying were always recconed to the charges of coyning. And the extraordinary salaries upon Warrant went with the incident charges as an Article not provided for by the Act, excepting that the Master about eight or nine years ago ordered the extraordinary salary of the Wardens  second Clerk amounting to 40li per annum to be recconed into the 3000li.

        Mint or Mints  & of the Assaying, melting down wast & 
            coinage of  Gold & Silver into the said  Mint or Mints there to be coyned &c. 
        The first is the charge of supporting a standing mint, the second is the 
        further charge of carrying  on the coinage in that Mint. And by the 
        next clause of the Act the  first is limited to 3000li per annum to prevent  extravagance the other  left unlimited because the coinage is not to be stinted but encouraged. The words 
        are:  And it is hereby further enacted, That there shall not be issued 
            out of the Exchequer of the said moneys, in any one year for the fees 
            & salaries of  the Officers of the Mint or Mints & towards the providing maintaining  & repairing of the Houses Offices & Buildings &

        with their appurtenances necessary for constituting a Mint (such  as are convenient chimneys hearths floors & places for Furnaces & other instruments) are limited to three thousand pounds; & the overplus is for 
        defraying the chargs  arising by the coynage  such as  are the charge of

        refining & allay for bringing the silver & gold to standard, Flasks  Furnaces
melting & wast in the  Melting house, Mills  Dyes & coining & in other Offices. And in this sense the Act has been constantly understood as may appear by the  old Accounts of the Warden & Master. For in those Accounts the salaries upon the establishment of the Indenture  amounted to 2600li &  there remained only 400l for the providing & repairing of buildings which usually amounted to two or three hundred & sometimes almost 400li per annum Whence I gather that from time of making the Act these were recconed the charges of supporting the Mint & all other charges were recconed into the coinage & incidents. In the 4th and 5t year of her Majestys reign an Act passed for enlarging the sum of 3000 to that of 3500li & in the Preamble to the Act are these words: 
        And whereas the said 3000li has been by experience found not to be sufficient, & the residue of the moneys arising by the said  Coynage Act is appropriated as in the said Act is mentioned{.} Be it therefore enacted &c.  +
    
     < insertion from the left margin > 
        + Here the design of the Act is not to charge the 3000 with other sorts of {accounts} then those which used to be placed upon it, but on the contrary to enlarge it for bearing those sorts of charges  which had been placed upon it & for which it had been found by experience not sufficient,  & particularly for making room for new salaries to the moneyers. 
     < text from f 339r resumes > 
        
        Here the words appropriated as in the said Act is mentioned, were certainly intended not to alter the sense of the former Act  or to signify any  other appropriation then what is mentioned in that Act
        
         <339v> 
        
        nor any thing further then that the residue of the moneys is so far restraine{d}  to  to  the coinage & the incidents that it cannot be applied to the payment of salaries & repairs of buildings &  things necessary to the being of a Mint.

And now the limit of 3000li is augmented to 3500li, & 400li are added to the salaries, the master is to pay to the warden the charges of repairs provided they do not together with the salaries exceed 3500li also usual incident charges without restraining by that limit. In the Accounts for the year 1712 the salaries upon the Indenture payable by the Warden are 1435li, those payable by the Master  re to the Officers 1080li  to the Moneyers  400li, to the Smith 40li, & to the Graver for an Apprentice 35li.

When this Act was  made, a salary of 400li per annum  to the moneyers was added & the salaries of the Clerks were intended to be augmented out of the other 100li, but  some of he buildings being ready to fall it was thought fit to take care of rebuliding those in the first place. And there has been since laid out about 900 or 100li upon new buildings besides the ordinary charges of repairs. And the Mills-rooms are ready to fall & will cost siz or eight hundred pounds to rebuild them. And while the salaries of the other Officers have been doubled & tripled the Masters salary has not been augmented these 140 years &  180li per annum going out of it to the Diet,  New years gifts {at} the Treasury, & a Deputy & his house is made & {illeg} to him one half of it being taken from him.

And thereupon the Moneyers were allowed a salary of 400l & the salarys of the Clerks were intended to be augmented: but several buildings being ready to  drop,  it was thought fit to rebuild them first.

Two years ago the Engineers shop was rebuilt & cost about 359li whereof  183li comes into the Account of the year 1712 & 176li is reserved for the last year. In the Indenture of the Mint there is a clause that the charges of making the bullion agreeable to standard shall be born & sustained out of the Revenue arising to her Majesty by vertue of the coynage Act: which clause would have been needless had that charge been recconned within the 3000li. This clause is a Voucher to the Master for the charges of Assaying & Allay, The Act of 18 Carol. II is a Voucher to him for the charges of the Assay Office, & the standing practise of placing the charge of furnaces in his Account is a voucher for that Article. No part of the 3000li should come into the Master's Account except the salaries payable to himself & those under him. 18 Car. II, chap. v.

This clause is a voucher for the charges of assaying & allay. The Act of 18 Car II is a Voucher for the charges of the Assay Office.

II, chap. 5, saith that no moneys leviable & payable by this Act shall be applied or converted to any use or uses whatsoever other then to the defraying the charge or expence of the Mint or Mints, & of the Assaying melting down wast & coinage of Gold &  Silver & the encouragement of bringing in of Gold & Silver into the said Mint or Mints there to be coyned &c. The first is the charge of supporting a standing Mint, the second is the further charge of carrying on the coynage in that Mint. And by the next Clause of the Act the first is limited to 3000li for preventing extravagance, & the other is left unlimited for encouraging the coynage. The words are: And it is hereby further enacted, that there shall not be issued out of the Exchequer of the said moneys, in any one year, for the fees & salaries of the Officers of the Mint or Mints & towards the providing maintaining & repairing of the Houses Offices & Buildings & other necessaries for assaying melting down & coyning above the summ of three thousand pounds sterling money, & the overplus of the said moneys so kept or to be kept as aforesaid shall be employed for & towards the expence wast & charges of assaying melting down & coynage & buying in of gold & silver to  coyne, & not otherwise
Here the charge of salaries & buildings with their appurtenances necessary for constituting a Mint (such as are 
         Hearths  
        & chimneys convenient for furnaces, floors convenient for Mill rooms, blocks for the presses & flatters benches for the cutters & for the Graver & smith, tables for weighing  telling & sizing stalls & Desks for the Clarks  money chests & boxes for the Treasury, & Pix {illeg}ells Pumps & Pipes for water doors & locks for the Offices, Gates for the Mint &c) are limited to
    3000li, & the overplus is for defraying the charges arising by the coynage such as are the charge of stationary ware for the clerk{s}  ballances & weights for  several Offices, Furnaces Cuppels water-silver, Aqua fortis & charcoal for the Assay Office, refining & allay for bringing the gold & silver to standard, flasks furnaces melting & wast in the melting houses Mills Dyes coyning & wast in the other offices.   Indentures & Warrants for carrying on the coynage, & charges of making trial pieces & trying the Pix. After the making of this Act the salaries upon the establishment of the Indenture amounted unto 2600li & there remained only 400li for the providing & repairing of buildings which charge in the old Accounts usually amounted unto two or three & sometimes almost 400li per annum And the Incidents in the Wardens Account came to about 180li per annum or within 20 or 25li over or under. And there is an Article in the Indenture which obliges the Master to pay unto the Warden such summ & summs as are payable by him for salaries & repairs & such other expences of the Mint as have been heretofore usually paid by the Warden. The Act made in the 4th & 5t year of her Majesty reign for enlarging the summ of 3000li to that of 3500li was not intended to charge the 3000li with any sorts of payments which had not been used to be put upon it but on the contrary to make more room for bearing those sorts of payments which used to be put upon it, as the words of the Preamble import. And accordingly a new salary of 400l per annum was settled upon the Moneyers presently after the passing of the Act. And the Salaries of the Clarks of the Mint being thought too small were intended to be augmented. But it was thought fit first to take care of the old buildings which were ready to fall. And since that 
        
         <354v> 
        
        time there has been spent upon rebuilding old houses & offices & extraordinary repairs about 900 or 1000li. And a part of the charges of rebuilding the Engineers shop comes into the Account of the year 1712. In the Account of that year the salaries upon the Indenture payable by the Warden are 1435li, those payable by the Master to the Officers 1080li, to the Smith 40li in lieu of 50li, & to the Graver for an Apprentice. 35li in lieu of 95li. The new salary to the Moneyers is 400li. And the charge of the buildings in the Wardens Account is in one article 389li. 2s in another 11. 13. 6. Total 3390l. 15s. 6d. "

        into Scotland to survey Sir Iohn Ereskin's mine &  was further paid 129li for 129 days after the rate of 20s per diem during his stay in Scotland upon this service, & 25li in discharge of  bills for clearing the Mine of rubbish, fitting up a place for making the assays & some other charges there. And that upon my paying to him the last part of this money he gave me a receipt in full of all accounts. This was Aug. 16 1717. But when he gave in his account to your Lordships which was May 17th 1717, he recconed 20sh per diem due to him till Aprill 29th preceding, on which day he delivered the Report concerning the Mine to your Lordships, which was for 71 days longer then it was allowed to him. For by the Princes Warrant it was due to him only till Febr. 18th preceding, that being the day on which he & Iames Hamilton left Edinburgh  to {gone} return to London And as for the charge of  their journeys  forwards & backwards, that was included in the allowance which hath already been made to them as is expresed in your Lordships Warrant to the Earl of Halifax dated 24 Iuly, 1717 for ussing money to discharge their Account. The sixty pounds imprest to  Brandshagen & the thirty to Hamilton before they went down to Scotland, included this charge, as may be understood  by your Lordships Warrant to the Earl of Halifax dated 5th Septem. 1716.  The 71li set down by Mr Brandshagen in the first of the three Articles annexed  to Mr Walkers Petition, & the 35li 10s set down in the second Article,  as due to him were therefore not due to him.

Of French coyns.  The French money is Lewidors double, single  half  & quarter & the silver Lewis Ecu Doller or Crown, the half crown the quarter crown or Cardecu the 12th part of the crown or Reau & the piece of 312 sous or         . By many assays of Pistoles they were found some 34 legr. worse then standard more of them 14 legr. worse, none standard most of them 12 legr. worse. One with another they were about 49 legr. worse & weight 4dwt 718gr. Double Pistoles new out of the Mint weight 8dwt 16gr, & single ones 4dwt. 8gr. In round recconing we may put Pistoles 12 legr. wors & weight 4dwt 8gr new coynd, 4dwt 7gr commonly current & lightned by wearing. When new coyned they are equally sized & assayed but in 20 or 25 years lose a grain by wearing. Some weigh but 4dwt 6gr some few 4dwt 5gr or less. The double French Pistoles are generally heavier then two single ones, being less worse Silver Lewises new out of the Mint weigh one with another  17dwt 1314gr or thereabouts, but in every six or seven years wearing lose a grain more or less. They are less equally sized  & allayed then the gold. They size the Lewidors to half a grain their silver Lewises to 112 grains. The assays of tenn pieces were as follows. One coyned 1651 worse 212dwt, another 1675 better 112dwt, another 1680 standard another 1682 better 2dwt. another 1687 standard another coynd 1690, restampt 1694 worse 1dwt. A 7th 8th 9th & 10thstandard  better 1dwt, worse 8dwt. One with another they were worse 710dwt. But if the last be omitted they were one with another better 19dwt. These tenn pieces & two others weighed one with another
     17dwt 10gr. The eight heaviest of them weighed one with another 17dwt 12gr, The two heaviest 17dwt 1314gr, The  three next 17dwt 1214gr. The three next 17dwt 1034. The two next 17dwt 712gr & the two lightest 17dwt 358, being lightned by wearing. Of the eight heaviest five were coyned 1651, 1679, 1680, 1682, 1687. The other seven were coyned before 1694 & then restampt. The French standard is 11 ounces fine & one ounce of Allay for both gold & silver. And they cut a Mark into 3614 Lewidors & 81112 silver Lewises A Mark is 8 ounces & an ounce is 8 Gross, 24 Deniers, 20 Esterlings, 40 Maill{es} 80 Felins & 576 grains, & a Denier is 24 grains. A Mark French is 7 ounces 17 penny weight & 9 grains Troy & an ounce is 47218 grains Troy & an ounce French is to an ounce Troy & a Mark French to eight ounces Troy as 60 to 61. The remedy  in weight for gold monies in France is two Felins or 1145 grains English & the remedy for silver monies is the twelft part of a silver Lewis or 3532107gr english. And they make their money lighter in the Mark then the just weight by above half the remedy, vist by about 35ts of the Remedy that is by about 7 grains Troy of gold & 21 grains Troy of silver in the Mark. So that 3614 Lewidors + 7gr & 81112 Lewises + 21 grains is the Mark French. The Remedy of Allay is in gold monies 14th of a carat, or One grain or 196 of the whole weight, that is one grain, & in silver monies two deniers per ounce or the 144th part of the whole, that is 23ds of the remedy for gold.  Their Remedy is only in defect of weight & fineness. If their money be too heavy or finer then the standard the Masters of their Mints lose the excess, if  lighter or coarser & yet within the Remedy they are at the Kings mercy. They make their gold coarser then standard by about 12 or 23 of the Remedy: but their silver Assays being less certain & yet the Remedy scanter they make their silver money one piece with another finer then their standard chusing rather to lose by the fineness then hazzard being without the Remedy. And its observable aslo that our Assays in the Tower make the gold & silver of Importers

        which is worse then standard to be at least 14dwt better then they are. Lewidors new coyned are in value to Guineas of due weight & allay as 4 to 5 & for every half grain that a Lewidor is lighter then 4dwt 8gr a penny must be deducted from its value. Ecus new coyned are worth 4s 6d15 of good standard money, & for every two grains by which the Ecu is  by wearing grown lighter then 17dwt 1314gr must be abated one farthing. In French Flanders are coyned pieces of 4 Livers, 2 Livres, one Livre, half Livres & quarter livres. A two livre piece coyned 1687 with this inscription about the head Lud. XIIII D.G. Fr. et Narav. Rex & on the Reverse about the French arms quartered with a crown on the Escutcheon, Sit normen domini benedictum 1687 & edged with Domine salvum fac Regem Christianissimum, weighed 12dwt 016gr. Another of the same date a little more worn weighed 12dwt –14gr. In exchange a Pistole & two pence is to a guinea  as 4 to 5. The assays of 15 Lewid'ors were as follows. worse 14, 34, 58, 14 full, 134 scant, 14, 12{,} 112, 12, 34 full, 12 scant, 34, 34, 34legr Which is one with another 23 legr. worse. In the books of the Mint Ingots melted out of Pistoles generally run 12legr worse. Some few Ingots (scarce one in twelve) are 14 or 34legr worse & more are 34 worse 14 worse: so that they ma{y} be recconed  51100legr worse."

If they can be weighed by Troy weights  (as they may be here if they should come for England) they may be received by such weight as bullion 1dwt worse then  our standard. But if they cannot conveniently be weight they may be told & received as bullion by recconing every thousand Dollers to weigh 872 ounces Troy, provided they  have not been culled since they came from the west-Indies.

And if the Dollars at Port Mahoa are all of them perfectly unworn they may be received by this weight. But if they are a mixture of Dollars worn & unworn  (for Merchants receive them in America not of the Mint master but of the people  with whom they trade) they may be  received here at the weight of 872 ounces per thousand: three ounces in the weight of every thousand Dollars being abated for the wearing. For  Merchants find this to be their weight as they come from the West Indies. Those that are unworn & fresh out of the Mint may be known by their glossy colour & the sharpness of their lines & edges. Pillar  pieces are finer then the Mexico but ` scarce so weighty. Refiners reccon them of about the same value with the Mexico by weight & fines together  They are but few in number Sevil pieces are all worn there having {bee}n none of them coined since the year 1686.

Farthings & halfpence being very scarce, insomuch that publick houses are forced to use Tickets: and at having been thought necessary to coin one hundred Tons  of Copper per annum for ten years, for supplying great-Britain, Ireland & the Plantations; several Proposals have been made for doing thereof, all which have been calculated for private  advantage only, without any regard to the Publick. It is humbly proposed to coin the said Quantity, in the manner & on the terms following; in case his Majesty will be pleased to give the Benefit of the Coinage to the Publick, vizt The farthings & halfpence to be made of fine Malleable copper, with a neat fair impression, to be approved by such person or persons as his Majestys shall appoint. Each pound of Copper to be cut into two shillings: One fourth part when coyned, to be allowed to the Publick, which will amount to five thousand  six hundred pounds per annum & amounts in the whole to fifty six thousand pounds. The Proposer will allow the Officers of  His Majestys Mint two-pence halfpenny for cutting stamping & blanching each pound of Copper. In case they refuse the same the Proposer humbly desires the use of the Irish Mint & will be obliged to leave the Presses & Vtensils in as good Order as they now are, without putting his Majesty to any expence If any Objections arise the Proposer desires an Opportunity to answer them, which he doubts not  but to do to the satisfaction of this Honourable House. Considerations upon the foregoing Proposal  1. Several Proposals have been made for coyning copper money by Patents  without accounting for the profit all which have been calculated for private advantage. And the Officers of the Mint have constantly given their opinion against them & represented that the coynage should be upon Account. 2. It never was thought necessary to coyn 100 Ton per annum for ten years unless  by those who designed to make a private advantage thereby. Such a coynage in three or four years would make a great clamour. In the last coynage of copper money six hundred Tons were found sufficient for all England & began to make a clamour, & the Proposer doth not offer to be at the charge of sending any into Ireland & the West Indies. 3 If it be right to cut a pound weight into two shillings & gives six pence thereof to the publick, its better to cut a pound weight into 2s 6d or 3s & give one shillings or eighteen pence thereof to the Publick. On the contrary the Commons in the year 1694 addressed King William that the Copper money should be coyned to the intrinsic value (including the charge of coynage) & the Officers of the Mint have upon all occasions given their opinion to the same purpose that the  temptation to counterfeit the money might be as little as possible. 4 The Proposer submits himself to no cheque or Account whereby it may appear how well the money is coyned in point of weight & assay & how much is coyned & what profit he makes of the coynage: but on the contrary endeavours to engross the whole coynage  into his own hands & by consequence to have it in his own power to coin the money coarse & light for is own profit. Whereas he that  provides & prepares the Copper for the Mint should import it by the assay of the Mint & at a certain rate by weight without having it in his power to make a profit by coyning it coarse & light & in greater quantity then he accounts for."

        also that the multiplying of Mints tends to promote the skill of 
        counterfeiting the gold & silver moneys as happened in the coinage of Tin half pence & farthings in the beginning of the reign of King William & Queen Mary. For obviating these objections 
        & that of the insignificancy of a Controller  of such a Mint, I humbly propose that

        annexed Memorial of the three Commissioners appointed by her Majestys late 
        Privy Council of Scotland to receive all the Scots & forreign coin 
        & see it melted into Ingots &  deliver the Ingots by weight 
        & assay to thhe Master of the Mint at Edinburgh upon this Note to be coined & to certify the deficiency; in which Memorial they  humbly desire that your Lordship 
            will be pleased to appoint them a suitable reward for their own 
            attendance & trouble & for paying their Clerk & other servants & 
            defraying the daily charge they are put to  
            & grownd their Petition upon their Commission which bears that they shall be sufficiently rewarded: We have considered the said Memorial, & because the business of these Commissioners 
            requires diligent attendance  in their own persons & constant circumspection at the meltings, & their 
            trust  in receiving the old money by tale & weight  & certifying the deficiency is also considerable; We are humbly of opinion that they may deserve for themselves & for paying their 
            Clerk & other servants, a reward after the rate of two pence per pound eight of all the Ingots of silver delivered from the melting pot to the Master of the Mint by weight & assayed to be coined.  And because these Commissioners  in conjunction with the Bank of Scotland  act as  common Importers for all the people  & in their service and do the buisiness which private Importers must have otherwise done for themselves  or procured to be done at their own charge, before the silver could have been delivered into the Mint to be coined & are entrusted between the Commissioners of the Equivalent & the people to  keep an account; the charge of imploying these Commissioners is in our humble opinion to be put upon the account of the Importers & allowed out of the equivalent as a part of the losses which private persons sustein by the recoinage of their money,  this recoinage 
        being required by the Act of Vnion & being impracticable without this allowance.
         In obedience to your Lordships Order of Reference of the 27th of

        buisiness of these Commissioners requires diligent attendance in their own persons & constant circumspection at 
        the meltings, & their trust in receiving the old money by tale & weight & certifying the deficiency is also considerable, We are humbly of opinion that they may 
        deserve for themselves &  their Clerk & other 
        servants, a reward after the rate of two pence per pound weight Troy of all the Ingots of silver delivered from the melting pott to the Master of the Mint to be coined. And because these Commissioners in conjunction with the Bank of Scotland, act as common Importers for all the people, & do the buisiness which private Importers must have otherwise done for themselves or procured to be done at their own charge before their silver could have been delivered into the Mint to be coined, & are entrusted between the Commissioners of the Equivalent & the people to keep an account of the importations & their deficiency: the charge of imploying these Commissioners is in our humble opinion to be put upon the account of the Importers & allowed out of Equivalent as part of the losses which private persons sustein by the recoinage of their money, this recoinage being required by the Act of Vnion & being impracticable without this allowance, & the Bank &

By the Act of Vnion a Mint is to be continued in Scotland under the same Rules as the Mint in England. And therefore all the Coinage moneys for Scotland should be issued out of the Exchequer of great Britain to the Master & Worker (not to the General) for the use & service of that Mint in general terms & applied, not by the Warrants of the Treasury but by the Officers of the Mint to particular uses, those Officers taking care that no greater summ be applied to Salaries Repairs of Buildings & Incidents then the Coinage Act allows. For this is the constitution of the Mint in England setled by the Coinage Acts. In the coinage Act of the 7th of the Queen, there is a Clause for issuing from the Exchequer of great Britain any summ not exceeding 1200li to the Mint in Scotland for Salaries & repairing that Mint. Had this money been issued in grenerall terms for the use & service of that Mint as it ought to have been by the Act of Vnion, it might have sufficed for Defraying all the charges of that Mint including the coinage, as it did in the reign of King Iames II & King William, the whole charge in those days not exceeding 1200li sterling one year with another. But they who drew up that clause have restrained all this moneys to salaries repairs & incidents of the Mint without taking care of the coinage & now come to the Parliament for 500li ore out of the coinage Duty to carry on a coinage in Scotland. And this the coinage moneys are taken away from the Mint in England, & the Officers of this Mint are forced to apply to the Parliament for more moneys. For preserving this Mint & reducing the Mint in Scotland to the same Rules, the following amendments to the coinage Bill are here proposed. Fol. 2. lin. 13 After the words [duly put in Execution] add [with relation to the Mint or Mints in England] Ibid lin 16. After the words [of this present Act] add the clauses AA. The first Amendment is for voiding or droppping the aforesaid irregular clause in the coinage Act of the 7th of the Queen. The second is for setling the Mint in Scotland upon the same Rules as the Mint in England as it ought to be by the Act of Vnion, & in such a manner that the two Mints may not interfere & obstruct one another."

May it please your Lordships  The two persons who are ordered down to Scotland being sent as I presume with an intent only to survey the Mine with the ground about it which belongs or lately did belong to Sir Iohn Ereskin & is said to  contein silver,  & to examin the Ore &  under Mr Haldane send the brother in law of the said Sir Iohn Ereskin & Mr Haldane living neare the mine & having expressed himself willing to encourage & supervise the said two men & forward their deisgne: I humbly propose (pursuant to your Lordships directions,) the following instructions as proper for this purpose. 1 That in the presence of substantial witnesses, the  said two men break 
        off from each of the two veins of Ore which are in the said 
        mine, about six or eight pounds of Ore & seale up the same 
        in two papers with inscriptions upon them denoting what 
        vein each  parcel is taken from; the inscriptions to be signed by the 
        witnesses, & the two parcells to be packed up together & sent 
        to London to the Lords Commissioners of his Majestys Treasury to be 
        assayed in London by their Order. The Witnesses may be 
        Mr Haldane & one or two of his Sons who are Parliament Men, 
        & Mr Drummond the Warden of the Mint at Edinburgh or 
        any other Gentleman of credit whom my Lord Lauderdale General of the said Mint shall please to send thither for his own satisfaction & the satisfaction of the Government, & any other person 
        or persons whom your Lordships  shall order to be present. 2 That  in the presence of the same witnesses other pieces of Ore be 
        broken off from each of the said two veins & assayed twice or oftener & the assays reported by 
        the said two men, & signed by the said Witnesses in testimony of their
being made before them, & sealed up & sent also to the Lords Commissioners 
        of his Majestys Treasury. And that a description of the breadth & depth & distance of the said two veins be also sent & which way they run, & how deep is the Mine 3 That the Casks (or  old Hogsheads & Barrells) which were 
            filled with about 40 Tunns of Ore dugg  out of the said Mine 
            by order of the Lady Ereskin in the time of the late rebellion
            & buried on the north west side of her house just by the Gate thereof 
            be enquired after, & a report made thereof & of what that 
            Ore holds by the Assay.  4. That the Burn or Channel made in the south side of the mountain 
            by  floods running down about three or four furlongs westward from 
            
             <253v> 
            
            the said mine within Sir Iohn Ereskins part of the mountain, be 
            well viewed to see what sparrs & other signes of minerals are found 
            therein, & if any Ores of Minerals or Metalls be found there to assay them 
& report the produce. 5 About two miles westward from thes silver mine there is 
            a Copper mine said to be very rich in Copper & Silver, so as 
            in a pound of Ore to hold about half a pound of Copper & twelve penny weight of 
            Silver & to belong to one who went into the rebellion. If two or three  pieces  of that Ore can 
            be procured, let it be assayed to See how much Copper & how 
            much silver it holds. And if there be any other mines within 
             three or four miles of the  silver mine,  let them examin what 
            silver the Ore may contein. 6.  Let them view all Sir Iohn Ereskines part of the mountain 
        & observe what signes of Mineralls may appeare any where 
        above ground, & report  what they find, & give the best account they can of  any other metallic Mines which they can heare of in that mountain. 7 I humbly propose also that Mr Haldane senior be desired 
            by a Letter from your Lordships to see that the two Gentlemen sent down 
            do put these things in execution, & to give them Directions from time to time 
            to do what he may think further proper for giving his Majesty & his 
            Royal Highness & your Lordships Satisfaction in this Matter. And that the two 
            Gentlemen sent down be ordered to observe the directions of Mr Haldane 
            in making these enquiries & observations{.} And that the Earl of Lauderdale General of his Majestys Mint at 
            Edinburgh be also desired by a Letter to give the two Gentlemen sent 
            down his protection & encouragement & to send either Mr Drummond 
             Warden of that Mint or some other  intelligent & credible person to the Mine, who 
            may there see the silver Ore dug out of the Rock & assayed, & may give his Lordship & the Government an account thereof. If this Mine shall prove a true silver Mine, the Kings Council  learned in the Law may be consulted about the right which either the king may have 
            to it as a Royall mine or the Commissioners for the forfeited estates 
            may have to it as a forfeited estate, & about 
                
                the right which either of them may have to the 40 Tunns of Silver Ore already dug up & about  
             the authority requisite to seize them in order to work the Mine & smelt 
            the Ore; and also about the Kings right in the Copper Mine two miles 
            westward, as a Royal Mine rich in Silver, tho not belonging to Sir Iohn 
            Erskin. And when the Fact & the Law is known, the  Silver Mine & 
            the Ore may be seized as the Law shall direct, & the Kings right in the 
            other mine may be also asserted."
